My Vista installation has to wait a while longer. Toshiba does not support Vista on the Satellite M30 and considers it an out of date model ( ??? ). Though the hardware is perfectly capable of running Vista with Aero glass. NVidia doesn&#8217;t have Vista drivers for the GeForce Go 5X series GPUs. There are [hacky ways](http://www.canerten.com/windows-vista-on-toshiba-satellite-m30-hardware-drivers/) of getting this to work, but these are not stable so far from what I&#8217;ve read.

However, I&#8217;m in the mood to buy a new laptop. I&#8217;m looking at the Toshiba P100 series of laptops, as they have a decent mix of features i.e good graphics Nvidia geforce 7600 with at least 128 MB of video ram, IGB of memory and a 100gb hard drive. My budget for all this is about £1000. I play games on my laptop and it serves as my main entertainment center therefore it should have a&nbsp; decent graphics card. Should be able to run secondlife and need for speed :). I&#8217;ve narrowed down my requirements and now just need to hunt around the shops more till I get it for as cheap as possible. It&#8217;s cheaper to buy a laptop with 1 GB of RAM and upgrade it later. Crucial is selling 2 GB kits for less than £100. The price difference between a 1GB laptop and a 2GB model is close to £250.
