Ok, I&#8217;m back. 


  


Haven&#8217;t posted because I was swamped with coursework. One more semester to go and I&#8217;m done. 


  


And now i&#8217;m catching up with Seasons 1,2 and 3 of Alias. I&#8217;ve seen only Season 4&nbsp;and that ended in a cliffhanger last week.&nbsp;Vaughn tells Syd that he is not who he says he is and his name is not really Vaughn, and then their car gets slammed by another (and they are about to get married). Why&nbsp;tell secrets in a moving car ? !!!!!&#8230;&#8230;.


  


I got the DVDs for the older series and I&#8217;m busy watching them ðŸ™‚


  


Next week I&#8217;m off to the Microsoft .Net roadshow. I&#8217;m looking forward to the SQL server sessions and any goodies.


  


On a serious note, I&#8217;m looking for a client to do my Masters degree final project with. The project should include an IT strategy for the client, plus development of an application.
