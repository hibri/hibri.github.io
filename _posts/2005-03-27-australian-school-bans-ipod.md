An [Australian school bans the iPod](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/24/australian_school_bans_sadpod/), on the grounds that it encourages isolation and turns people into social outcasts.


  


&#8220;A private school in Australia has banned its pupils from listening to their iPods. The yuppie consumer gadget will not be permitted in class, because it encourages kids to be selfish and lonely, according to the school principal.&#8221;


  


I have to agree with this though. We are increasingly shutting out our environment with all sorts of electronics and withdrawing into an electronic shield.


  


However, on the lighter side [should iPods carry health warnings ?](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/27/ipod_health_warnings/)
