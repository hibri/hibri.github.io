In the midst of fiddling with the Xbox, I took the second part of the MCSD to MCPD uprade exams. I got a&nbsp; voucher to do the first part (70-553) at the Visual Studio 2005 launch event. I got around to doing the second part (70-554) yesterday. I passed with a comfortable 820. This is the last of the certifications till the .net 3.5 series comes out.
