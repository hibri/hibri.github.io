This is one nice collection of controls. These are what MS didn&#8217;t include in their control library and what other vendors charge a hell of a lot. I&#8217;ve used the toolbars and menus for some applications. The licensing is quite resonable. The free version can be used to try out the control. This should be in every Winforms developers toolbox.
