After adding an extra 1 GB of RAM, I found that my laptop will not hibernate.
  
This&nbsp;is a bug in Windows XP.&nbsp;A bit of Googling got me here;

<http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=909095>

However, the fix is not available for download yet. You have to call MS
  
support and they will email the fix.&nbsp;I somehow got the patch. Download it
  
[here](/content/binary/Hibernatefix252701_ENU_i386_zip.exe), extract
  
the file to a folder and install.
