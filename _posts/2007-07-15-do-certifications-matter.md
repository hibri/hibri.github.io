_&#8220;The certification alphabet is no substitute for a solid portfolio; you should be spending your time building stuff, not studying for multiple choice tests. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re worthless, either. I don&#8217;t think certifications get in the way, as long as you can demonstrate an impressive body of work along with them.&#8221;_

I couldn&#8217;t agree more. I find that there is a misconception&nbsp;MS certifications are software development qualifications. Many budding developers think of this as a must have and expect to get programming skills through the certification program. They fail to realize that the MCP/MCSD/MCPD certifications are product certifications rather than programming certifications.
