I should be receiving my copy sometime this [month](http://blogs.msdn.com/ianm/archive/2007/03/13/list-of-winners-and-update-on-the-office-delivery-date-uk-developer-launch.aspx). This was for answering a question after the UK&nbsp; Vista and Office developer launch event. I thought I didn&#8217;t&nbsp; win since I didn?t get the email from MS. Yesterday I requested a list of the winners and my name is on the list.&nbsp; Yippee !!&nbsp; ðŸ™‚

Ok, now I have to find a laptop to run it, my current laptop is showing its age. In retrospect, I should have entered the Office competition because I would be able to use that on this laptop.&nbsp;
