Should I be wary of Thursdays ?&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Was trying to go to a friend&#8217;s place in Wood Green (North East London). Went
  
to Victoria station to get the Vicroria Line, only to be told it was
  
shutdown&nbsp;upto Warren Street, we then went back to Embankment to try to get
  
there using the Northern Line, just as we got off the train, the station was
  
evacuated. So we go out, and try to figure out what bus to take. We then walked
  
to Trafalgar Square and had&nbsp; a calm lunch while the police were running
  
around with sirens blaring. At last got a bus to take me to Hammersmith and then
  
home. Started at 12 and its taken 5 hours to get home and I&#8217;m dead tired from
  
all the walking.
