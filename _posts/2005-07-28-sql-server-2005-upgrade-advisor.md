&#8220;The Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Upgrade Advisor is a tool used by Database
  
developers and administrators to analyze SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server 2000
  
database servers in preparation for upgrading to SQL Server 2005. The Upgrade
  
Advisor will allow users to analyze the configuration of their existing database
  
services and database applications. As a result of this analysis, Upgrade
  
Advisor will provide reports that identify deprecated features and necessary
  
configuration changes that will impact their Database upgrade process. Upgrade
  
Advisor will also provide links to documentation that describe these changes and
  
necessary steps to complete the process.&#8221;
