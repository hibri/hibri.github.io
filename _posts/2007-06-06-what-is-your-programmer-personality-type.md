My&nbsp;[programmer personality type](http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11) is:

**DHSC** 

You&#8217;re a **D**oer.  
You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money. 

You like coding at a **H**igh level.  
The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way. 

You work best in a **S**olo situation.  
The best way to program is by yourself. There&#8217;s no communication problems, you know every part of the code allowing you to write the best programs possible. 

You are a **C**onservative programmer.  
The less code you write, the less chance there is of it containing a bug. You write short and to the point code that gets the job done efficiently.
