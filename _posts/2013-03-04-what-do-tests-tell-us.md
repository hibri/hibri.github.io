Back in September 2012, I gave a talk at Dev&#8217;s in the Ditch on what tests tell us.&#160; The talk resonated with a post by Matt Wynne today on fixing slow builds.

[Optimising a slow build ? You are solving the wrong problem](http://blog.mattwynne.net/2013/03/04/optimising-a-slow-build-youre-solving-the-wrong-problem/).

Slow builds and test suites with a large number of tests are an architecture smell. An indicator that there is something wrong with how you have built the application. I covered a few other things that tests or the lack of them tell us, in my talk.
