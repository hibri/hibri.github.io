[BBC Worldwide](http://www.bbcworldwide.com) (my employer) is sponsoring a conference on software craftmanship on the 26th of February 2009. This is about the skills you need to build better software. This is about the refactoring skills, spotting code smells and habits that make you a better developer.

The programme and registration details are at [Software Craftmanship 2009](http://parlezuml.com/softwarecraftsmanship/ "Software Craftmanship 2009")&#160;

This conference is not about how to do Agile, or how to get started with TDD or how to get started with a certain technology. The conference is programming language agnostic and the skills can be applied to any programming language.
