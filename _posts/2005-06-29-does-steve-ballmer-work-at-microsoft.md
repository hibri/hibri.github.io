According to this article <http://zdnet.com.au/news/software/0,2000061733,39199269,00.htm>

&#8220;**Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer confessed the software giant&#8217;s .NET
  
strategy has come to a standstill, says he&#8217;s accepted SQL Server&#8217;s shortcomings,
  
and vowed to keep fighting search giant Google**&#8220;

Why exactly has the .Net strategy stalled&nbsp; ? does this mean&nbsp;2.0
  
will be delayed again ?

Given all the goodies that are supposed to come out later this year, and the
  
amount of .Net code being used why has the .Net strategy stalled ?

Any comments ?
