I&#8217;ve got my new laptop mostly working my way. Spent last weekend installing all what I need. I skipped VS 2005 and went straight for Orcas. Got most of the applications I need installed. The laptop came with Vista Home. I had to upgrade it to Vista Ultimate before I could do anything useful with it.

The keyboard feels a bit clunky compared to my old laptop. Maybe this is because the keyboard area is larger and the base of the laptop is much thicker. Winamp crashes when trying to play http streams.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t figure out yet how to enable Integrated Authentication in IIS 7, to debug web apps with Orcas (works fine with the built-in web server though). Orcas needs to run as administrator. HD content plays well after installing the K-Lite codec pack.

File copy is DEAD slow in Vista. Doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to re-connect to a wireless network after resuming from hibernation when DHCP is enabled. Haven&#8217;t had any major show stopper crashes yet. I&#8217;ll give it a spin for a few more weeks, and probably install XP.

And yes Live Writer froze 3 times while writing this post.
