Funny presentation by Rich Bowen <http://people.apache.org/~rbowen/presentations/apacheconEU2005/hate_apache.pdf>

On the same topic is there a GUI administration tool for Apache on Windows
  
?

I&#8217;m looking for information on how Apache for Windows compares to IIS.
  
Since&nbsp;Apache Win32 can be used with .Net, how many of you will use it in a
  
production environment ? Since any Windows Server comes with IIS anyway my
  
opinion is that this is not a very useful combination, other than to use it for
  
testing on a development machine. IIS 6.0 has given&nbsp;good a&nbsp;performance
  
in my experience, but I havn&#8217;t compared it against Apache Win32. IIS 6 would
  
have the upper hand since the HTTP processing is integrated into the
  
kernel.
