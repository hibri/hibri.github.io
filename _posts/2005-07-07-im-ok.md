Just to let everyone know that me and my family are ok. Although I&#8217;m very
  
shocked that it actually happened. I never expected it to happen in London, but
  
so much for that.

As of now there are 37 fatalities. This has been well planned to scare and
  
create chaos, but not much of chaos. This has hit the transport system bad, but
  
I think it will be back to normal soon. Travel on the Underground will not be
  
the same again. However, London has handled it very well&#8230;good work by the
  
authorities
