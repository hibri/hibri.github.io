nothing to write about. not much happening. I&#8217;m graduating with an MSc in IT
  
Consulting in December, just got my results confirming it. It has been a hard
  
year, and I&#8217;m relieved that its all over now. I&#8217;ll be going back to work soon.
  
More details on that later.

VS 2005 is out. Get your hands on it. If you are looking for free copies
  
(like me) MS is giving them away at their launch events. I&#8217;m attending the 15th
  
of November event at the Novotel in London.&nbsp; I&#8217;m skipping the ASP .Net
  
sessions on the 14th&nbsp;because I know quite a bit about that already. I&#8217;m
  
more interested in the Biztalk, SQL server 2005 &nbsp;and Team suite sessions. 

Eid Mubarak to all of you &#8230;
