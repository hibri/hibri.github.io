Two good articles on using the new features in ASP. Net 2.0

I like the script call back feature using XML-HTTP. This can replace a Java
  
Applet I built sometime back.

Its good to see that some of the code I&#8217;ve written using the 1.1 runtime be
  
part of the base class library. This would make development so much faster.

On the other hand are Java Applets still relevant ? The use of JavaScript and
  
XML-HTTP is increasing. Combine that with the wonderful interfaces Flash can
  
produce and you have the capability to deploy very light weight web based
  
apps.
