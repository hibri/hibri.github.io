A while back I organised a coding session during an internal training day at work.&#160; The aim of the session was to introduce practices&#160; from the [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0132350882?ie=UTF8&tag=hibrinet-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0132350882) book, to make code a little bit cleaner and practice the [boy scout rule](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1235624&seqNum=6).&#160; I’ve tried to include the important points from the book, though everything in the book is equally important.

I’m sharing the slides and the code. Feel free to use it and improve on it. The code is a Sudoku solver from the [Programming In the Small](http://www.parlezuml.com/softwarecraftsmanship/sessions/programming_in_the_small.htm) session at SC ‘09. I’ve converted the Java code to C#. The code includes acceptance tests, so you can fearlessly refactor without breaking it.

The session was planned for 90 minutes. It includes slides introducing clean code concepts, with coding exercises to practice them. I recommend 10-15 minutes for the coding exercises.
