Pramod Sadalage, has written an article on Behaviour Driven DB development. <http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=78>.

He writes about adding behaviour to the domain model and how that behaviour is translates into database objects, with tests. In the project I&#8217;m working on, which driven by a Web UI I use the UI behaviour to build the presenter and&#160; through this add behaviour to the domain model. It&#8217;s at the last stage that I add the persistance, through Nhibernate.
