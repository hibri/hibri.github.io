I bought a [Picooz](http://techdigest.tv/2007/02/picooz_worlds_s.html) on impulse a few weeks ago. I saw it on display and it was only Â£30 and it gave me a &#8220;What the heck, its only 30 quid&#8221; moment. Turns out that I&#8217;ve bought the world&#8217;s smallest RC helicopter, weight about 10 grams. Though it is small, it does have a lot pf power in it. The copter charges from the RC controller and takes about 20 minutes to charge for a 5 minute flight.

It&#8217;s hard to control it at first, though I&#8217;m getting the hang of it. It&#8217;s a very forgiving toy and handles all the bumps and crashes very well. Indestructible so far :). Getting the Picooz to fly forward took a bit of hacking it. It has a tendency to fly in circles and get into an un-controllable spin. This happens even after trimming. I added a nose extension, which looks like an antenna to add a bit more weight to the front so it&nbsp;can fly&nbsp;forward slowly.
