An article by Robert Adler&nbsp;in the [newscientist](http://www.newscientist.com/) says that the [rate of technology
  
innovation is decreasing](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7616). In the US the period between 1847-1915 was the
  
most innovative period, with the rate of innovation peaking in 1915. 

My analogy on this is&nbsp;; Innovation is like digging for treasure. Humans
  
have found the easy to find&nbsp;treasure (electricity, nukes, Internet etc..
  
).. and now we have to dig harder to find the rest. The problem is we are not
  
digging as hard as we did&#8230;.
