Thanks to all of you who have used this and given me good feedback. I&#8217;ve made
  
an update based on all the comments recieved so far.

1. File copy bug fixed. Now corrects Album names with invalid characters in
  
them, so the copy process does not crash.

2. Now copies AAC files too. Thanks to Martin for letting me know what the
  
w800i supports AAC (.m4a files).&nbsp; This does not support protected AAC
  
(.m4p)&nbsp;files such as tracks purchased from the iTunes Music Store.

3. Added a Quick Launch icon.

Please download the](/content/binary/synchsetup.msi) and keep the comments coming in.

**Instructions:**  
1. Install all of the requirements.  
2.
  
[Download the setup](/content/binary/synchsetup.msi) and
  
install.  
3. Start iTunes, if it is not started the program will start it for
  
you, but be patient.  
4. Select the playlist you want to synch with the phone.
  
It is better to create a new playlist like &#8220;W800i List&#8221; and add your tracks to
  
this.  
5. Click on the **Synch** button to start
  
synchronising.  
6. This takes a while. You can speed up the copy process by
  
using a Memory Stick reader, which is faster than going through the USB data
  
cable. Take the memory stick out of the phone, put it in the reader, plug the
  
reader in and synch.
