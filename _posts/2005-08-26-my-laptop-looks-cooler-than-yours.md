well, now this is neat&#8230;

<http://en.crystalxp.net/bricopack-vista-inspirat.php>

This shell pack gives my XP Pro a Vista inspired look and feel. Now the
  
nicest thing about this theme is that it modifies all the system dlls and
  
changeshack.e all the icons and other resources inside. I spotted a process
  
called &#8220;Reshack.exe&#8221; running while i was installing this. It&#8217;s not heavy scince
  
it is not anything additional. It could do with some more work, the icon edges
  
are jagged in places.

However, I do like the way it redcued the size of my task bar. The black slim
  
task bar is really nice, and saves more screen space. The whole thing can be
  
uninstalled safely&#8230;
