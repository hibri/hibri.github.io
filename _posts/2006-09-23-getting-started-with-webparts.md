I was looking into ASP.Net Webparts&nbsp;last week. Here are a few helpful resources.

Sahil Malik introduces Webparts by conducing a walkthrough of creating a qucik and not so dirty CMS (content management system) <a href="http://www.developer.com/net/asp/article.php/10917_3618431_1" target="_blank">link</a>&nbsp;

A <a href="http://www.developer.com/net/asp/article.php/3627871" target="_blank">good introduction</a> into writing custom editors for web parts by the same author.

A MSDN <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/09/WebParts/default.aspx" target="_blank">article</a> giving an overview of the whole framework.
