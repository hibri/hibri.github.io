A wonderful event on a warm Saturday at the Microsoft campus in Reading. 

The complete agenda is [here](http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/agendaddd3.asp) . The slides should be up shortly.  The sessions were full of very useful tips and tricks for SQL 2005, Atlas, .Net  and security. 

On the topic of security, check out the work of [Dinis Cruz](http://www.owasp.net/), who demonstrated how easy it was to hack a .Net application ( for those of you gloating, the same techniques can be applied to Java and C++ apps). The presentation makes a developer think again of all those login dialogs. Dinis has more material on the [OWASP](http://www.owasp.net/) website. 

Christian Wade&#8217;s session on SQL 2005 had some useful tips on .Net code in SQL server and security issues. Common table expressions and tips to optimize recursive queries were also covered. 

The Atlas session by Thomas Brattli was packed (Thomas is the founder of [www.dhtmlcentral.com](http://www.dhtmlcentral.com/), most of you would have used his JavaScript menus) . He demoed how easy it was to AJAX enable ASP.Net pages and develop gadgets for live.com 

Dave Sussman did the final session on Health Monitoring .Net applications. He introduced concepts that I didn&#8217;t even know existed. There is more info [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/paght000011.asp).

Kudos to Phil for organizing a great event.
