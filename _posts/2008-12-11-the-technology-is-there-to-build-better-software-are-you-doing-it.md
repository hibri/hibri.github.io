here is a random thought I had today.

From what I&#8217;ve seen, in the past 2 years, agile practices have spread among the .Net community.&#160; The .Net framework&#160; gives us the power to do TDD and follow other agile principles.&#160; the community is now empowered with a rich API , so that we don&#8217;t have to worry about how to build things.&#160; We now have to worry about what we can build and how to build it better. 

We have been freed from the shackles of VB and classic asp, with a good OO framework, that is getting better. You name the problem and there is a very good .Net based tool to help you solve it. You want mocking , you have Rhino Mocks, you want persistence you have NHibernate, you want testing APIs, you have Nunit, Mbunit and what not.&#160; 

The technology and tools to build better software is here, are you using it ? if not what&#8217;s stopping you ?
