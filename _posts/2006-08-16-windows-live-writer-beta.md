Get it while its hot [http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/PersonalS&#8230;](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/PersonalS...)

&nbsp;Supports pictures, Flickr photos.. image effects&#8230; and yes spell checking. Good support for dasBlog.

There&#8217;s an indepth review here [http://blogs.vertigosoftware.com/ericc/archive/200&#8230;](http://blogs.vertigosoftware.com/ericc/archive/200).

The coolest feature is the WYSIWIG editor, which shows exactly how the post will look on the site. It downloads the style from dasBlog.

Lots of pros.

Cons: 

<strike>1. Can&#8217;t delete posts.</strike>&nbsp; Can delete posts ðŸ™‚

1. Can&#8217;t add new categories.
