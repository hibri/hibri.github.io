I&#8217;m evaluating PHP versus .Net for an application I have to build. One factor
  
that favours PHP is hosting costs. LAMP hosting is much cheaper than .Net
  
hosting. PHP gives most of the functionality that .Net can give, more like
  
classic ASP so the higher cost of .Net hosting cannot be justified. So I&#8217;m
  
learning&nbsp;PHP and MySQL. I&#8217;m pretty good with Linux but never tried any
  
development on it.. so here goes. I&#8217;m planning on using Apache [mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html), there
  
is an IIS equivalent but not so powerful as mod_rewrite. If I had done this in
  
.Net, I&#8217;d have to write it as an http handler. I might do this later but its
  
nice to have this as part of the web server. [A few regular
  
expressions is all it takes](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/guide-url-rewriting).
