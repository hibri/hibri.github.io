Typing this post from my laptop with a 1 GB upgrade. Total memory is now 1.5
  
GB. Can now run SQL server 2005, and VS 2005, and running Azureus in the
  
background :).

Among other things, I&#8217;ve been pretty busy with work and there hasn&#8217;t been
  
much to blog about. My UK visa issues have now been sorted out, and I can now
  
work here without any restrictions.

There is a new show on Channel 4 called the [IT
  
Crowd](http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/). The episodes are available online, and watch it if you
  
can.
