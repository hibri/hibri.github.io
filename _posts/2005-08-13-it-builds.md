Finally got Dasblog to build under .Net 2.0. I got an update to the migration
  
wizard from <http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/07/421827.aspx>&nbsp;(Thanks
  
[Chris](http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog)). There were 2 snags in the
  
migration. The dasblog.web project was not converted because there wasn&#8217;t a IIS
  
virtual directory for it, I created a virtual directory and reloaded the
  
project. VS 2005 then converted the project. However it missed one file
  
&#8216;Activity.aspx&#8217;. I had to change the codebehind attribute to codefile and the
  
class declaration to a public partial. After this the project compiled, but
  
still will not run. A resource assembly seems to be missing. I&#8217;ll have to hunt
  
this issue later. Atleast I got to the point where the site runs and gives me a
  
stack trace. The web site does not work under IIS and only on the development
  
webserver. 

fyi I&#8217;m converting dasblog 1.6.4121.1.

If anyone has any .Net 1.1 to .Net 2.0 conversion stories,tips,tricks and
  
gotchas to share.. please let me know. As I posted earlier I was able to convert
  
a 1.1 Winforms project with no problems, and this was under the Express
  
edition.

anyways more on this later&#8230;
