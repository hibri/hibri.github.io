Found out today that IE has tabs, not directly but by using the latest
  
version of the MSN [toolbar](http://toolbar.msn.com). As an [Opera](http://www.opera.com) user this is not so groundbreaking, but it
  
is somewhat useful for those IE only sites. The whole screen flickers when
  
switching tabs and it would be good if clicking on a link with the srcoll wheel
  
opens the link in a new tab. I do like the Windows desktop search that comes
  
with the whole package. I like the search while&nbsp;type feature, and it
  
doesn&#8217;t use a browser to show the results like Google Desktop search does. This
  
is the app I like out of the whole package. It offered pdf searching before
  
Google so I&#8217;m sticking with it.
