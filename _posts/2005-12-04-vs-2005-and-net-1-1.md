I was reading a blog post on blogs.msdn.com about why each version of VS is
  
tied to a version of the runtime, and the reasons why multiple versions of the
  
runtime are not supported. Anyways I can&#8217;t find the link :).

For VS 2005, an add-in is [under development](http://blogs.msdn.com/clichten/default.aspx)&nbsp;to
  
build under 1.1.&nbsp; Targetting the latest version of&nbsp; .Net is viable for
  
server side projects (ASP .Net etc..). However, for client
  
applications&nbsp;this is not always possible.&nbsp; The majority of Windows
  
computers will now have the 1.1 Framework, so applications can be deployed
  
without worrying too much about distributing a 20 MB runtime. It will probably
  
take about 6 months to a year for the same thing to happen to the 2.0 Framework.
  
Untill then, those developing for 1.1 are still stuck with an IDE that rewrites
  
code, makes controls disappear and other magical stuff that makes one tear their
  
hair out.

On the same topic, where can I find statistics on what percentage of Windows
  
machines have what version of the runtime. Internet Explorer sends the .Net
  
version on the UA string, so it might be possible to measure the usage of 2.0
  
versus 1.1 This should be easy for MS to pull up from their web server logs and
  
publish the stats :)..
