I&#8217;m looking at two browser based HTML editors. I&#8217;ve shortlisted my choices to
  
two TinyMCE <http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/>&nbsp;and
  
FCKEditor <http://www.fckeditor.net/>.
  
Both are F/OSS and TinyMCE is used on Mambo. It is quite customisable but I
  
still have to figure out&nbsp; how to fit in my own custom image filemanager.
  
FCKEditor comes with a filemanager, but does not have the feature to disable
  
buttons on the editor. This is because I wont need all the features (may confuse
  
users). If I&#8217;m able to do a file manager for TinyMCE, I&#8217;ll use it. 

On the same topic, [PostXING](http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog/)&nbsp;is what I&#8217;ve been
  
using to post entries on here and very happy with it. Very stable and has good
  
editing features. Now only if they would add a spell checker.
