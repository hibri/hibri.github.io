Thinking of ways to measure code readability. How easy is it to read and understand a&nbsp; method, or class ?

Number of branches in a method ? more branches -> more complex&nbsp; hence a more complex method&nbsp; that is hard to read 

Split the camel casing of a method/class into words and run some sort of word analysis to check if the words make sense ?

The analysis has to be automated, and run as part of CI ideally..
