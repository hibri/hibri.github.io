Update 18-12-2006.

This is no longer an issue, with the final release of Outlook 2007. I don&#8217;t know where it has been fixed, either on AVG or Outlook. 

A very dissappointing development is that, Grisoft has decided to discontinue the free edition of AVG.

<strike>There is an e-mail rendering problem with Outlook 2007 Beta 2 when used with the Grisoft AVG Outlook plugin.&nbsp; AVG certifies each incoming email as safe. This causes Outlook not to render the message body. Outgoing messages are blank too.</strike>

<strike>The fix is to disable the email scanner. I found that the message bodies of my pre and post AVG emails are readable.</strike>

<strike>AVG says this is about </strike>[<strike>MS</strike>](http://forum.grisoft.cz/freeforum/read.php?3,69472,page=1,backpage=3,sv=)<strike> not following standards, no comments from the Office team yet. Hope this is fixed soon, as AVG offers an excellent free , light weight AV solution.</strike>
