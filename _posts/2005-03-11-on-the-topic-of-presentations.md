In my limited experience with presentations and from what I&#8217;ve learned here are some few pointers.
  



  


  1. **Keep each slide brief** , but cover the main points. Do not cram a lot of text on the slide.
  
      * **Keep the presentation notes simple.** Do not have a huge pile of notes. Your notes should be brief and expand upon the text in the slide.
  
          * **Keep eye contact with the audience.** Look at everyone. This has two affects. First, is that you can see how the audience is responding and secondly, it builds the confidence levels since it feels like you are talking to someone and not just an empty room.
  
              * **Know the power of pauses and silences**. Pausing during a presentation gives the impression that you are confident. It also allows to recover from nervousness. Use frequents pauses to make the presentation enjoyable, and not seem like reading something
  
                  * **It is normal to be nervous**. If someone says that they are not nervous during a presentation, then something is wrong with them. It is natural. You have to know that you are nervous and not let it overwhelm you.
  
                      * **Always look at the audience, and not at the screen or the computer.**
  
                          * **Do not talk down to the audience.** You are the expert in what you are presenting, but do not treat the audience like dummies.
  
                              * **You must be able to explain anything you put on the slide, no matter how insignificant it is**. If you put something up there and someone asks you a question about it, it will look very very bad if you can&#8217;t explain it. So if you don&#8217;t know what it is, do not put it on the slide
  
                                  * **Relax, and smile.**
  
                                      * **Practice, Practice and practice**. No matter how many you have done, do this. It builds confidence
  
                                          * **Never try to read from your notes**. Remember, you are presenting not reading
  
                                              * **Create your own presentation, and make your own notes**. If you are using someone else&#8217;s slides, atleast make your own notes </OL>Credit goes out to my tutors who have hammered these points into me ðŸ™‚</p>
