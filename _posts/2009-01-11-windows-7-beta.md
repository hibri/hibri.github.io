Typing this from a laptop running Windows 7 Beta. This is an older laptop, which is now idle because it has been replaced by a new Dell Studio laptop. Toshiba Satellite M30, 1.5GB RAM, GeForce Go 5200 with 64MB video ram. The only problem was finding the driver for the GeForce Go 5200. I found the Vista 32 bit drivers for this from [here](http://downloads.guru3d.com/download.php?det=1530 "GeForceGo 5200 32bit drivers for vista"). I’ve got full Aero running, it it’s quite snappy. All the other drivers are the normal Vista 32 bit drivers.

Win7 hasn’t picked up the power management utilities from Toshiba (?), trying to see if the utilities from my other Toshiba laptop will work on this. Looks very good so far. Think I’ll wait for Windows 7 to upgrade my main laptop to a 64 bit OS. I’m still not very happy with the driver support from nVidia, and ATI does not seem to be much different either.
