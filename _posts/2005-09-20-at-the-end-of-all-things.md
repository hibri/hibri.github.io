I&#8217;ve finished the last part of my Masters degree and the last 4 weeks have
  
been very stressful. Now i just have to sit and wait for the results of my
  
project, but I have a pretty good feeling about it :).

I&#8217;m trying to get back into my &#8220;work&#8221; mode, after being a student for a year.
  
Quite a bit to catch up on. I&#8217;m&nbsp;brushing up on .Net patterns &
  
practices. I&#8217;m also getting all the betas installed on my laptop, as I didnt
  
want to risk anything earlier when I was doing course work. I&#8217;m on a &#8220;install
  
fest&#8221; this week.

Stuff left to install..

&nbsp;WSE 3.0 beta, WinFX SDK, LINQ tp and last but not least Ubuntu linux. 

The nice people at Canonical just sent me 10 Live and Install CDs. 

anyways more later, just enjoying the relief for a bit ðŸ™‚
