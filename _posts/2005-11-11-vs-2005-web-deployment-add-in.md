For all of you ( like me) who were frustrated a bit with the new web project
  
system in VS 2005, this add-in resolves some of those issues.

This uses creates a Msbuild&nbsp; file to give more fliexibility with
  
deploying web projects. 

Single assembly for the whole app, with a name of your choice, versioning,
  
assemblies for each directory. Anyways, much more control over the build
  
process.
