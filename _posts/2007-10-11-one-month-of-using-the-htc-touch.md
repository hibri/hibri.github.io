I bought a HTC Touch pocket PC a month back. It&#8217;s quite a nice and compact phone with Windows Mobile 6. It&#8217;s not a great touch phone,the WM6 interface is not touch very touch friendly. The stylus is needed most of the time.

I got the phone mostly to have an organizer, access the Internet at times and to try my hand at writing some code for the Pocket PC. The phone came with a Motorola S9 Bluetooth headset (for free !!), and now the phone is my default music player. I connect the phone through ActiveSync to my work desktop, and use&nbsp; media player on the phone to play streaming music.&nbsp; I can now code and walk around the office with no wires to mess about with :).

A major downside to the phone is that typing text messages requires the use of the stylus. There are rumors that HTC will release a full screen soft key board that is touch friendly. I found a soft keyboard last night, called&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cootek.com/intro.html" target="_blank">TouchPal</a> . It is a nice interface but takes some getting used to. Typing with two fingers&nbsp; blackberry style does not work well. One fingered typing works ok so far. 

The stereo earphones that come with the phone are not great for listening to music, but fine for phone calls. On the other hand the S9 headset is great for cutting out external&nbsp; noise and playing music but when on calls the audio sounds muted. 

The phone does not come with Windows Live Messenger installed, but a download can be found using Google.
