and removing it kills Windows.

From the [Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/01/sony_rootkit_drm/),

&#8220;_Sysinternals&#8217; Mark Russinovich has performed an analysis of the copy
  
restriction measures deployed by Sony Music on its latest CDs: which he bluntly
  
calls it a &#8216;root kit&#8217;. **Using conventional tools to remove Sony&#8217;s digital
  
media malware will leave ordinary users with a dead Windows
  
systems**._

_While the Sony CDs play fine on Red Book audio devices such as standard
  
consumer electronics CD players, when they&#8217;re played on a Windows PC the
  
software forces playback through a bundled media player, and restricts how many
  
digital copies can be made from Windows_.&#8221;

Avoid Sony CDs.. if you can.. scary stuff.
