[DevConnections &#8211; The ASP.NET MVC Framework](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/181552579/DevConnectionsTheASPNETMVCFramework.aspx "DevConnections - The ASP.NET MVC Framework")

ASP .Net MVC != Web Forms 4.0

_&#8220;One important point I kept stressing in the talk was that this is designed to be compatible with the ASP.NET subsystems you already use. That means Session, Cache, Personalization, Roles, Membership, etc, still work and are there to be used and abused. This framework, in the namespace System.Web.Mvc, is an alternate architecture, but **not** &#8220;an entirely new parallel ASP.NET,&#8221; no more than any of the other home-grown or open source MVC/MVP frameworks that are out there&#8221;_
