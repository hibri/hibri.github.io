Was searching&nbsp; for Web Accessibility info and got this site <http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/>  
From
  
reading all of this, it is not hard to create accessible websites, all that is
  
needed is the mindset and sticking to a few simple rules. The side effects from
  
building an accessible website is that the site&#8217;s usability is increased. This
  
makes it easier for normal people to use the site. The articles also suggests
  
that accessibility improves search engine rankings. This makes sense because if
  
the structure and content of the site are cleanly separated it will be easy for
  
a search engine bot to crawl through the site. It also makes the site easier to
  
view from other devices such as phones and PDAs.

I also learnt about the label tag for the first time. [Using the](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms1.html)[](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms1.html)[<](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms1.html)[label](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms1.html)[>](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms1.html) [](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms1.html)[tag to](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms1.html)[](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms1.html)[label form elements](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms1.html) will
  
set the focus to the form element when the label text is clicked. Why go through
  
complex tables and css when there is a simple set of [tags to group related](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms2.html) [](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms2.html)[form elements](http://www.ua-wg.org/articles/forms2.html), just like
  
the group box control in Windows Forms. This also shows a simple way to group
  
items within a dropdown box.

This site conforms to Priority 1 of the WAI guidelines, but with many
  
warnings. There is an automated testing tool at <http://webxact.watchfire.com/>. From the
  
errors given, it doesn&#8217;t seem much work to make this site conform to all 3
  
checkpoints. To conform with the UK Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) a
  
website will have to conform to Priority 1 and Priority 2 of the [WAI guidelines](WAI%20guidelines).
