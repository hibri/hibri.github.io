If you live in the UK and looking to pick a new broadband provider, have a look at the <a href="http://www.samknows.com/broadband/news/now-available-our-first-performance-monitoring-report-417.html" target="_blank">performance monitoring report</a> by the broadband information site <a href="http://www.samknows.com/broadband/" target="_blank">samknows.com</a> . The report is based on data gathered by routers attached to volunteers’ connections. My provider <a href="http://www.bethere.co.uk/" target="_blank">Be Unlimited</a> does fairly well and is in the top 3 in terms of performance. They do have a problem with a slow DNS server, which I solved a while back by switching to OpenDNS. Overall, for £18 a month, no contract plus a static IP, its well worth the money. If you are a bandwidth hog like me its a good deal. They advertise 24Mbps, but in reality the average is around 15 – 18 Mbps. I consistently get 17 Mbps, which is pretty good. 

The straight line distance to the exchange from my place is around 500m, but according to BT the actual cable length is around 2Km. This and the old wiring at my place is probably why I’m not getting anything close to 24. I’ve been able to get 7Mbps, by connecting the router directly to the <a href="http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/socket.htm" target="_blank">BT&#160; master socket</a> .
