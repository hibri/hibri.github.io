Symmetric-key encryption is much faster than public-key encryption; however, public-key encryption provides better authentication techniques. An SSL session always begins with an exchange of messages called the SSL handshake. The handshake allows the server to authenticate itself to the client by using public-key techniques, and then allows the client and the server to cooperate in the creation of symmetric keys used for rapid encryption, decryption, and tamper detection during the session that follows. Optionally, the handshake also allows the client to authenticate itself to the server.  \n<div class=\"topOfPage\">  \n<table>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"image\">[<font size=\"2\">![Back to the top](http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/library\/images\/support\/kbgraphics\/public\/en-us\/upArrow.gif \"Back to the top\")<\/font>](http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;257591#toc)<\/td>  \n<td class=\"text\">[<font size=\"2\">Back to the top<\/font>](http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;257591#toc)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><\/div>[]()  \n\n## <font size=\"2\">MORE INFORMATION<\/font>\n\n  \n<div class=\"sbody\">The steps involved in the SSL handshake are as follows (note that the following steps assume the use of the cipher suites listed in Cipher Suites with RSA Key Exchange: Triple DES, RC4, RC2, DES):  \n<table class=\"list\">  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"number\"><font size=\"2\">1.<\/font><\/td>  \n<td class=\"text\"><font size=\"2\">The client sends the server the client\u2019s SSL version number, cipher settings, session-specific data, and other information that the server needs to communicate with the client using SSL.<\/font><\/td><\/tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"number\"><font size=\"2\">2.<\/font><\/td>  \n<td class=\"text\"><font size=\"2\">The server sends the client the server\u2019s SSL version number, cipher settings, session-specific data, and other information that the client needs to communicate with the server over SSL. The server also sends its own certificate, and if the client is requesting a server resource that requires client authentication, the server requests the client\u2019s certificate.<\/font><\/td><\/tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"number\"><font size=\"2\">3.<\/font><\/td>  \n<td class=\"text\"><font size=\"2\">The client uses the information sent by the server to authenticate the server (see Server Authentication for details). If the server cannot be authenticated, the user is warned of the problem and informed that an encrypted and authenticated connection cannot be established. If the server can be successfully authenticated, the client proceeds to step 4.<\/font><\/td><\/tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"number\"><font size=\"2\">4.<\/font><\/td>  \n<td class=\"text\"><font size=\"2\">Using all data generated in the handshake thus far, the client (with the cooperation of the server, depending on the cipher being used) creates the pre-master secret for the session, encrypts it with the server\u2019s public key (obtained from the server\u2019s certificate, sent in step 2), and then sends the encrypted pre-master secret to the server. <\/font><\/td><\/tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"number\"><font size=\"2\">5.<\/font><\/td>  \n<td class=\"text\"><font size=\"2\">If the server has requested client authentication (an optional step in the handshake), the client also signs another piece of data that is unique to this handshake and known by both the client and server. In this case, the client sends both the signed data and the client\u2019s own certificate to the server along with the encrypted pre-master secret. <\/font><\/td><\/tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"number\"><font size=\"2\">6.<\/font><\/td>  \n<td class=\"text\"><font size=\"2\">If the server has requested client authentication, the server attempts to authenticate the client (see Client Authentication for details). If the client cannot be authenticated, the session ends. If the client can be successfully authenticated, the server uses its private key to decrypt the pre-master secret, and then performs a series of steps (which the client also performs, starting from the same pre-master secret) to generate the master secret. <\/font><\/td><\/tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"number\"><font size=\"2\">7.<\/font><\/td>  \n<td class=\"text\"><font size=\"2\">Both the client and the server use the master secret to generate the session keys, which are symmetric keys used to encrypt and decrypt information exchanged during the SSL session and to verify its integrity (that is, to detect any changes in the data between the time it was sent and the time it is received over the SSL connection).<\/font><\/td><\/tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"number\"><font size=\"2\">8.<\/font><\/td>  \n<td class=\"text\"><font size=\"2\">The client sends a message to the server informing it that future messages from the client will be encrypted with the session key. It then sends a separate (encrypted) message indicating that the client portion of the handshake is finished. <\/font><\/td><\/tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"number\"><font size=\"2\">9.<\/font><\/td>  \n<td class=\"text\"><font size=\"2\">The server sends a message to the client informing it that future messages from the server will be encrypted with the session key.

Symmetric-key encryption is much faster than public-key encryption; however, public-key encryption provides better authentication techniques. An SSL session always begins with an exchange of messages called the SSL handshake. The handshake allows the server to authenticate itself to the client by using public-key techniques, and then allows the client and the server to cooperate in the creation of symmetric keys used for rapid encryption, decryption, and tamper detection during the session that follows. Optionally, the handshake also allows the client to authenticate itself to the server.<br \/>\n<DIV class=topOfPage><br \/>\n<TABLE><br \/>\n<TBODY><br \/>\n<TR><br \/>\n<TD class=image><A href=\"http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;257591#toc\"><FONT size=2><IMG title=\"Back to the top\" alt=\"Back to the top\" src=\"http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/library\/images\/support\/kbgraphics\/public\/en-us\/upArrow.gif\"><\/FONT><\/A><\/TD><br \/>\n<TD class=text><A href=\"http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;257591#toc\"><FONT size=2>Back to the top<\/FONT><\/A><\/TD><\/TR><\/TBODY><\/TABLE><\/DIV><\/DIV><A id=kb2><\/A><br \/>\n<H2 class=subTitle><FONT size=2>MORE INFORMATION<\/FONT><\/H2><br \/>\n<DIV class=sbody>The steps involved in the SSL handshake are as follows (note that the following steps assume the use of the cipher suites listed in Cipher Suites with RSA Key Exchange: Triple DES, RC4, RC2, DES):<br \/>\n<TABLE class=list><br \/>\n<TBODY><br \/>\n<TR><br \/>\n<TD class=number><FONT size=2>1.<\/FONT><\/TD><br \/>\n<TD class=text><FONT size=2>The client sends the server the client&#8217;s SSL version number, cipher settings, session-specific data, and other information that the server needs to communicate with the client using SSL.<\/FONT><\/TD><\/TR><br \/>\n<TR><br \/>\n<TD class=number><FONT size=2>2.<\/FONT><\/TD><br \/>\n<TD class=text><FONT size=2>The server sends the client the server&#8217;s SSL version number, cipher settings, session-specific data, and other information that the client needs to communicate with the server over SSL.

In the certificates tree, under<br \/>\nTrusted Root Certification Authorities , find the certificate for Equifax Secure<br \/>\nCertification Authority and Thawte Premium Server CA. <\/p>\n<p>Now, export each of these certificates in turn as a DER encoded binary X.509<br \/>\ncertificate. Send these two files via a bluetooth or infrared link (does not<br \/>\nwork when the files are copied using file manager ). The phone will prompt to<br \/>\naccept the certificates&nbsp;and you are good to go :).<\/p>\n<p>Gmail also has a mobile interface at <a href=\"http:\/\/m.gmail.com\">http:\/\/m.gmail.com<\/a>, but this is not good enough to<br \/>\ncompose emails.<\/p>\n<p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 30 Dec 2005 18:23:18 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 30 Dec 2005 18:23:18 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 30 Dec 2005 18:23:18 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":402,"title":"Use iTunes to manage MP3s on your W800i Walkman phone","slug":"use-itunes-to-manage-mp3s-on-your-w800i-walkman-phone","markdown":"\nThe problem with Sony MP3 players is that the software is not intuitive and  \n buggy.

The main advantage of the ODS is that it allows you to maintain your layers, without polluting your presentation layer with data code.\n\nTo start off,\u00a0 drag and drop the ODS control to a web form. Set the TypeName property to the business object you want to work with. For example, if we have a\u00a0BO named Employees in the TimeTracker namespace, this will be\u00a0TimeTracker.Employee.\n\n**Selecting**  \n\u00a0A common scenario is to display the a list of records. Say we want to display the list of all employees in a GridView. To retrieve the records, the Employee object needs a GetEmployees static method that will retrieve\u00a0 all the employees from the DB.\u00a0 Set the [SelectMethod](http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.web.ui.webcontrols.objectdatasource.selectmethod.aspx) property of the ODS to GetEmployees. Now bind the ODS to the GridView just like any other data source.\n\nAt runtime the ODS uses reflection to find the GetEmployees method and invokes it.\n\n**Paging and filtering**\n\nFiltering Employee objects is as easy as adding a new method to your Employee object. If we want to select Employees by department, the Employee object should have a static\u00a0method\n\nGetEmployees(string department)\n\nIn the properties window of the ODS, add the department parameter to the [SelectParameters](http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.web.ui.webcontrols.objectdatasource.selectparameters.aspx) collection. You can set a default value to it, and this is where things get real easy. You can bind the parameter to a control on your web form ( like a DropDownList)\u00a0, a Session variable and even a query string parameter.\u00a0 Adding\u00a0 filtering functionality is simple as that. You can do the same programmatically by adding Parameters to the SelectParameters collection. Be sure to clear the collection before you add a parameter( or check if the parameter exists).\n\nPaging is where working with the ODS gets a bit complicated. To enable paging ( in conjunction with the GridView) set the EnablePaging property to true. The Employee object too, needs to have methods to support paging.\n\nWhen paging is enabled, the ODS calls the GetEmployee method with\u00a0two extra parameters. by default the parameters are **startRowIndex** and **maximumRows**. These can be changed by setting the [StartRowIndexParameterName](http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.web.ui.webcontrols.objectdatasource.startrowindexparametername.aspx) and [MaximumRowsParameterName](http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.web.ui.webcontrols.objectdatasource.maximumrowsparametername.aspx) properties.\n\nNow we need a GetEmployees method with the signature like  \nGetEmployees(int startRowIndex,int maxiumRows)  \nTo support filtering it will have to be GetEmployees(string department ,int startRowIndex,int maxiumRows)\n\nThe maximumRows parameter, will have the value of how many rows to display per page. This will have the value of the PageSize property of the GridView. The startRowIndex will contain the the index of the current page. This can be the starting row index of the current page of records. See [here for more on how to pass these on to an SQL query](http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2006\/01\/07\/434787.aspx).\n\nIn addition to this the ODS needs another method that is set by the [SelectCountMethod](http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.web.ui.webcontrols.objectdatasource.selectcountmethod.aspx) property. This is invoked to find out the total number of rows available. So we need another static method in our Employee object. GetEmployeesCount() .If the total number of rows is 100, and you have a page size of 20. The GetEmployees count method should return 100, so that the ODS can tell the GridView, how many pager links to display. I usually return this as an out parameter from the stored procedure that retrieves the paged results.\n\n**Inserting, Editing and Deleting**\n\nInserting, editing and deleting is pretty easy. All you will again is to have the appropriate static methods in the Employee object.  \nAddEmployee(Employee e)  \nUpdateEmployee(Employee e)  \nDeleteEmployee(Emplyee e).\n\nSet the [InsertMethod](http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.web.ui.webcontrols.objectdatasource.insertmethod.aspx) , [UpdateMethod](http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.web.ui.webcontrols.objectdatasource.updatemethod.aspx) and [DeleteMethod](http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.web.ui.webcontrols.objectdatasource.deletemethod.aspx) properties accordingly. All these method can be configured with parameters like the SelectMethod. However, setting the [DataObjectTypeName](http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.web.ui.webcontrols.objectdatasource.dataobjecttypename.aspx) property to the Employee object will reduce a lot of the hassle by passing Employee objects to the Add,Update and DeleteMethods.\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/9a4kyhcx.aspx\">The Object Data Source (ODS)<\/a> helps you expose your business objects, to provide data to databound controls&nbsp;such as&nbsp;the GridView, DetailsView and many other data bound controls.<\/p>\n<p>Compared to the other data sources like the DataTable and DataSet, the ODS does require some work to achieve the same functionality.

The experience is analogous to a situation where someone had already written the core CMS and given the project to extend. Sitefinity host simple ASP .Net controls. So developing a solution is the same as any other ASP .Net project. This is a big advantage for me, as I don\u2019t have to go and learn a new framework. Sitefinity uses the native ASP .Net provider model. This makes Sitefinity come close to SharePoint 2007.

An important one was a branching strategy.\u00a0 My team works on several user stories in a sprint. A sprint lasts 2 weeks ( 10 days).\u00a0 I wanted to release regularly at the end of each sprint.\u00a0\n\nPrior to implementing the branching strategy,\u00a0 the team worked off the trunk and released from it.\u00a0 This made the trunk less stable with in-complete features.\u00a0 The code was unit tested but not complete.\n\nWe wanted to have better control of what we were releasing for acceptance testing and to the production environment.\u00a0 Releasing the latest version in the trunk caused in-complete code go into a production environment. The strategy I introduced is [explained very well in this article](http:\/\/www.infoq.com\/articles\/agile-version-control \"Version Control For Multiple Agile Teams\"). I highly recommend reading this and using it as a starting point if you are working in an agile manner.\n\nTo summarise;\n\n> All development work is done in a development branch. For example, when developing\u00a0 a story, the work is done in a branch for the story. The branch is merged back into trunk when the story is complete (acceptance tested, unit tested, as long as it has met the requirements and is relatively bug free with no show stoppers).\u00a0 During development the developers working on the story branch pull down from the trunk so that they are always in synch with the trunk. When the story is done, the branch is merged back into the trunk and killed off.\u00a0 Several stories can be in development in parallel branches too.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that the trunk is kept relatively clean and has feature complete code ready to release. This makes life much easier for the testers as they have complete stories to test.\n\nNow this all sounds fine, but it didn\u2019t go smoothly as I expected.\n\nFirst off, most of my team had a steep learning curve in trying to branch and merge. We were working with TFS (Team Foundation Server) at the time. Creating a branch with TFS was a time consuming task. It took a good 10 to 15 minutes to create a new branch from the trunk and commit it back in to TFS.\n\nThe next biggest stumbling block for my team was the actual act of merging. Some found it hard to be disciplined and pull down from the trunk regularly, and to always do this first when merging a branch back into the trunk.\n\nTFS wasn\u2019t very helpful in when resolving conflicts, it tends get confused when the merge contained renamed files.\n\nA drawback of such an aggressive branching strategy was sharing code was hard. Improvements or refactored code made in one branch code not be shared by other branches. The code had to go into the trunk first before being pulled down by the other branches.\n\nSo at the end of two months where am I ?\n\nI decided not to branch so aggressively. Each story did not have to have a branch of its own. The general policy when creating branches is;\n\n1. Does the story depend on other stories in development ? If yes, use an existing branch.\n\n2. Will starting a new piece of work impact the release of an existing story ? Will it cause the release of one story to contain an incomplete feature of another story ? If yes, the new piece of work belongs in a new branch.\n\n3. Is the new work a bug fix ? Bug fixes on code already released are always in the trunk.\n\nIn general, we have settled on \u201cwork branches\u201d. Branches that can have independent releasable pieces of work. At most we have two branches at any given point in time. Usually there is a branch with work carried over from the previous sprint and all the new work for the current sprint is done in a new branch.\n\nWe also ditched TFS and moved to Subversion. This move was done last week, and my team is still settling into it. Creating branches with subversion is a snap. It was very easy to switch Cruise Control .Net to use subversion. We haven\u2019t still moved to [subversion 1.5](http:\/\/subversion.tigris.org\/merge-tracking\/ \"Subversion Merge Tracking\") and have to track the merge revision numbers manually.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a branching strategy, first consider if you really need one. If you do, and you are working in an agile manner start off with the approaches in this [article](http:\/\/www.infoq.com\/articles\/agile-version-control).\n\n1. Enforce strict discipline and synchronise branches regularly.\n\n2.No branch should go without merging back into the trunk at-least once every two days.\n\n3. Listen to the pain points of the team.\n\n4.I highly recommend paring with another developer when merging back into the trunk. Have a merge buddy.\n\n5. Always merge locally and not on the server, run unit tests and then check back in.\n\n6. The chances of a merge going wrong and loosing both the unit test and\u00a0 the code being tested is very little. A compile error will always spot this.\n\n7. Run CI on each branch.

The panel talks about\u00a0 these two topics and their experiences.\n\nWhat I gleaned from this is , doing the simplest thing does not mean doing the stupidest thing. Doing the simplest thing possible is under the constraints of proper separation of concerns, encapsulation and having tests to cover what is written.\n\nDoing the simplest thing does not mean you can dump your business logic, persistance and presentation logic all in the code behind file of an ASP .Net page. Keep doing the simplest thing possible by using existing design patterns that reduce the cost of change later. The simplest thing is not an excuse for writing bad code. Having proper separation of concerns in the design ensures that changes can be made in\u00a0 the simplest thing that was done earlier without adversely affecting the rest of the system.\u00a0\n\nThe domain model should not be aware of the persistance or presentation logic.

The domain model reflects the business and the decisions are usually made long before the project is begun.\n\nDoing the simplest thing that could possibly work usually means, how to persist a certain part of the domain model ? how to present domain model data ? and how to pass the data from the domain model to and from the different layers. It is how to implement a certain business requirement in domain model code.\n\nA key safeguard here is having tests (unit and acceptance tests ).\u00a0 While doing the simplest thing possible do write good unit tests.\n\nMartin Fowler talks about reversibility in design decisions. A good design decision is one that you can reverse and go back to the point before the decision was made. He stresses encapsulation again.\u00a0 Design decisions that are encapsulated are not expensive to change. If your persistance medium is changed, this decision should not affect the rest of the system. Proper separation of concerns isolates design decisions. The panel also stresses the importance of spiking. If you have choices to make, try those choices with a scaffold or a simple prototype and explore the options. It\u2019s much more cost effective to make a decision through spiking than to undo a choice made to production code. Again the emphasis is made on tests. Tests protect the system, they tell you how much you are likely to break.\u00a0\n\nDuring the past week a colleague of mine, did a fairly big refactoring of key parts of the code. He did it in a separate branch, and made sure that all the existing tests passed and wrote new tests where needed. Impressive. His design decisions do not affect the trunk, till we are sure that we are happy with it and it hasn\u2019t broken any part of the system.\n\nIn my current project I defer decisions till the first hint of pain of not making that decision appears.

His design decisions do not affect the trunk, till we are sure that we are happy with it and it hasn\u2019t broken any part of the system. <\/p>\n<p>In my current project I defer decisions till the first hint of pain of not making that decision appears. I make&#160; the choice just about when we are starting to hurt by not making it. I keep postponing it till then.<\/p>\n<p>To sum it all up;<\/p>\n<p>Do the simplest thing that could possibly work, do not repeat yourself defer decisions till the last possible moment, but still do write the best code you can, and drive the design with tests.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 17 Aug 2008 19:15:10 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 17 Aug 2008 19:15:10 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 17 Aug 2008 19:15:10 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":330,"title":"Tag cloud","slug":"tag-cloud","markdown":"\n[Wordle](http:\/\/wordle.net) tag cloud for my blog.

The signature is generated using a shared secret.\u00a0 The signature is for the whole XML except the hmac element. Before signing the message, we have to construct the XML without the hmac, then sign it, and then add then hmac.\n\nI did this by using a two stage Xml serialization process. This may not be the best way to do it, and there has to be a better solution.\u00a0 I created a class named SignedXMLSerializer, and this inherits from [XmlSerializer](http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.xml.serialization.xmlserializer.aspx). SignedXMLSerializer serializes objects that are of the base type Signable. The Signable class has two properties, Nonce and Hmac. Any class that has to be sent as a signed XML message must inherit from Signable\n\n<span class=\"kwrd\">public<\/span><span class=\"kwrd\">abstract<\/span><span class=\"kwrd\">class<\/span> Signable { [XmlElement(<span class=\"str\">\"nonce\"<\/span>)] <span class=\"kwrd\">public<\/span><span class=\"kwrd\">string<\/span> Nonce { get; set; } [XmlElement(<span class=\"str\">\"hmac\"<\/span>)] <span class=\"kwrd\">public<\/span><span class=\"kwrd\">string<\/span> HMAC { get; set; } }\n\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\n.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre\n{\n\tfont-size: small;\n\tcolor: black;\n\tfont-family: consolas, \"Courier New\", courier, monospace;\n\tbackground-color: #ffffff;\n\t\/*white-space: pre;*\/\n}\n.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }\n.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }\n.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }\n.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }\n.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }\n.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }\n.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }\n.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }\n.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }\n.csharpcode .alt \n{\n\tbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\tmargin: 0em;\n}\n.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }<\/style>\n\nIn the serialize method of the SignedXMLSerializer, we first generate the nonce.

Think about it as we write the test. It will become clearer gradually.\n\nI\u2019ll explain with an example.\n\nThe test name. This is the part where most of us get stuck. It\u2019s an art. Getting it right is solving half the problem, but lets not get stuck on it. It doesn\u2019t matter if we don\u2019t have the perfect test name at the start. Give it a name that is good enough.\n\n[Test] <span class=\"kwrd\">public<\/span><span class=\"kwrd\">void<\/span> Foo () { }\n\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\n.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre\n{\n\tfont-size: small;\n\tcolor: black;\n\tfont-family: consolas, \"Courier New\", courier, monospace;\n\tbackground-color: #ffffff;\n\t\/*white-space: pre;*\/\n}\n.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }\n.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }\n.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }\n.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }\n.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }\n.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }\n.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }\n.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }\n.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }\n.csharpcode .alt \n{\n\tbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\tmargin: 0em;\n}\n.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }<\/style>\u00a0\n\nThis is all we need for now.\n\nWe have name, we have a test, our test runner can run the test.\n\nNext. What is the proper outcome to test for ?.\u00a0 In other words what are we testing ?\n\nStart with the assert first.\u00a0 Assume we want the title property in some object set to the expected value. Don\u2019t worry about what type the object is, if you don\u2019t have it already.\n\n[Test] <span class=\"kwrd\">public<\/span><span class=\"kwrd\">void<\/span> Foo (){ Assert.That(fooObject.Title, Is.EqualTo(expectedTitle)); }\n\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\n.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre\n{\n\tfont-size: small;\n\tcolor: black;\n\tfont-family: consolas, \"Courier New\", courier, monospace;\n\tbackground-color: #ffffff;\n\t\/*white-space: pre;*\/\n}\n.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }\n.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }\n.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }\n.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }\n.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }\n.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }\n.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }\n.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }\n.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }\n.csharpcode .alt \n{\n\tbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\tmargin: 0em;\n}\n.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }<\/style>\n\nStart with the smallest thing you can assert. Let\u2019s not be concerned with all the other things that need to be tested. In the example code above, I\u2019m testing that an object named fooObject has it\u2019s Title property set to the expected string. At this point I\u2019m not concerned about the exact value of the expectation.\n\nWe have an assert. Something needs to happen in the thing we are testing. This is the action. Think about where we get fooObject from.\n\nSome action needs to be executed to get an instance. This action is a method. In code , the way to make something happen is to call a method.\n\nCreate a method. Let\u2019s not get stuck on the name too much. I\u2019ll call it Get(). Calling Get() gives me fooObject.\n\n[Test] <span class=\"kwrd\">public<\/span><span class=\"kwrd\">void<\/span> Foo (){ var fooObject = controller.Get(); Assert.That(fooObject.Title, Is.EqualTo(expectedTitle)); }\n\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\n.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre\n{\n\tfont-size: small;\n\tcolor: black;\n\tfont-family: consolas, \"Courier New\", courier, monospace;\n\tbackground-color: #ffffff;\n\t\/*white-space: pre;*\/\n}\n.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }\n.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }\n.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }\n.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }\n.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }\n.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }\n.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }\n.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }\n.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }\n.csharpcode .alt \n{\n\tbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\tmargin: 0em;\n}\n.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }<\/style>\u00a0\n\nWe have an assert and an action. The code even compiling yet. Keep typing.\n\nOur object controller needs to be an instance of something. Is this an existing object we are testing ?, if not I\u2019ll create it.\u00a0 We always have a context in which we are writing a unit test. This gives us an indication on what the thing we are testing should be called.\n\nIn this example, we are testing a Controller. Instantiate the controller object.\n\n[Test] <span class=\"kwrd\">public<\/span><span class=\"kwrd\">void<\/span> Foo (){ var controller = <span class=\"kwrd\">new<\/span> HomeController(); var fooObject = controller.Get(); Assert.That(fooObject.Title, Is.EqualTo(expectedTitle)); }\n\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\n.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre\n{\n\tfont-size: small;\n\tcolor: black;\n\tfont-family: consolas, \"Courier New\", courier, monospace;\n\tbackground-color: #ffffff;\n\t\/*white-space: pre;*\/\n}\n.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }\n.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }\n.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }\n.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }\n.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }\n.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }\n.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }\n.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }\n.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }\n.csharpcode .alt \n{\n\tbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\tmargin: 0em;\n}\n.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }<\/style>\n\nNext use resharper ( or similar tool for your language) to create the missing objects. Let\u2019s make the code compile at this time. Give a value for the expectation. Don\u2019t worry about which project (in Visual Studio) the classes will be in. It\u2019s fine to keep it in the test class for now.\n\n[Test] <span class=\"kwrd\">public<\/span><span class=\"kwrd\">void<\/span> Foo (){ <span class=\"kwrd\">string<\/span> expectedTitle = <span class=\"str\">\"some title\"<\/span>; var controller = <span class=\"kwrd\">new<\/span> HomeController(); var fooObject = controller.Get(); Assert.That(fooObject.Title, Is.EqualTo(expectedTitle)); }\n\n\u00a0\n\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\n.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre\n{\n\tfont-size: small;\n\tcolor: black;\n\tfont-family: consolas, \"Courier New\", courier, monospace;\n\tbackground-color: #ffffff;\n\t\/*white-space: pre;*\/\n}\n.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }\n.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }\n.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }\n.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }\n.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }\n.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }\n.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }\n.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }\n.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }\n.csharpcode .alt \n{\n\tbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\tmargin: 0em;\n}\n.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }<\/style>\n\nWe have an assert, action and arrange. Read it the other way.\u00a0 Arrange, Act and Assert. The 3 parts we need for a test.\n\nRun the test, see it fail. Write the bare minimum of code to make the test pass. Even hardcode things. Get a green bar. Even give temporary names.\n\nLet\u2019s refactor.\u00a0 Rename things. The test is much more clearer now. Rename Foo to ShouldSetTitleOnView.\u00a0\n\nRun the tests again, and keep renaming things. Move files to where they should be.\n\nAt this point we can think about injecting dependencies. Remember those hard coded values we put in to make the test pass ?\n\nInject a dependency to give those values. There is now a place to inject dependencies, the constructor of the HomeController.\n\nTo summarize,\n\nWriting the assert first, gives a focal point for the test. Working backwards from this focal point ensures that we write the bare minimum code needed to make the test pass. We don\u2019t need to worry about injecting dependencies that are not even relevant to what we are asserting.\n\nAvoid thinking about your team\/company standards of how you should write your tests. Just write the test with what you know.

It hides the details of the web service, and saves you the trouble of having to know how to parse XML or JSON. The wrapper gives you first class objects to work with.\n\nMany web service providers provide a wrapper for their services in most programming languages.\n\n### Why I don\u2019t like wrappers.\n\nI strongly believe that web services should be simple to use. If you expose a web service via HTTP, your consumers should be able to use any HTTP client to consume the service.\n\nYou should be able to use a web service by simply typing the URL for the web service method in the web browser\u2019s address bar and see the result in the browser itself.\u00a0 You should be able to use a command line tool such as [curl](http:\/\/curl.haxx.se\/) to call the web service. Using a web service should not be more complicated than this. If you were hardcore even telnet should suffice.\n\nTo consume the service in code, the bare minimum a\u00a0 developer should need is a decent HTTP client library and a standard XML\/JSON parser. Even a decent string library should suffice to make sense of the HTTP responses. These are pretty much available in the framework provided out of the box with the major programming languages. Of course there are situations where you\u2019ll need more, but then this should be the exception and not the norm.\n\nFrom the point of view of a web service provider, this simplicity increases adoption of your web service. Consumers don\u2019t have to wait for you publish a new version of the wrapper library in order to start using a new service endpoint. Maintenance of the wrapper library is a non-issue, as you can focus on fixing issues with the service only, and not the wrapper library.\n\n### Avoid using wrappers internally.\n\nWhen building a web service, avoid the temptation to use wrappers in your acceptance and integration tests. Strongly typed wrappers are a bad idea. I\u2019ve seen this first hand when writing tests when building the [7digital API](http:\/\/developer.7digital.net\/). Don\u2019t even parse responses to strongly typed objects. I\u2019ve forbidden the use of wrappers and strongly typed objects for testing the 7Digital API within my team.\n\nThe reason for this is, as a provider, you have to use the service as a consumer would. Wrappers hide the complexity of your own service, and you won\u2019t know how complex the service has become.\u00a0 When you work with bare HTTP response strings, you will see potential usability issues that consumers will face.\n\n### Publish sample code, but not wrappers.\n\nIf you are providing a web service, my recommendation is to publish sample code, and not wrappers around your service. Show developers how to consume the service in their favorite programming languages. A good idea is to give them tests as Martin Fowler recommends. The tests can serve as sample code. They can run those tests against your service and see where the problem lies.\n\n### Thoughts\n\nIn my experience, using a strongly typed language such as C# has been a bad idea.\u00a0 Dynamic languages like Ruby can be used to write more tolerant wrappers. This is because with Ruby you can evaluate the API responses at run time rather than having to use an object that requires the response to be in a certain format.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Martin Fowler\u2019s post <a title=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/bliki\/TolerantReader.html\" href=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/bliki\/TolerantReader.html\">http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/bliki\/TolerantReader.html<\/a> mirrors my thoughts on consuming web services. <\/p>\n<h3>What is a web service wrapper ?<\/h3>\n<p>A wrapper for a web service is a library, helps you deal with said service in the language programming language of your choice.

The system under test (SUT) works with a couple of web services to do its work. The problem I\u2019m faced with is that, when I write these tests, the external web services have to be arranged with data for the test, or the test has to rely on existing data. Writing these tests is extremely painful. Knowledge of the magic existing data is required and in the end what we are really writing are integration tests. But we don\u2019t want integration tests.\n\nAt [7digital](http:\/\/blogs.7digital.com\/dev\/), we are exposing more of our domain via HTTP APIs, in a \u201cNotSOA\u201d manner. To test each service by itself it becomes necessary to mock the dependencies.\n\n### Solutions.\n\nThere are a couple of solutions to this.  \n Set up an stub HTTP web service somewhere, and let it return canned responses. It behaves like the real web service, but only returns responses that have been arranged. The disadvantage of this approach is that I have to know about what canned responses have already been setup.\n\nTo change the response for a particular test I have to make changes to the stub server and deploy it, as it is a separate application.

The system under test (SUT) works with a couple of web services to do its work. The problem I&#8217;m faced with is that, when I write these tests, the external web services have to be arranged with data for the test, or the test has to rely on existing data. Writing these tests is extremely painful. Knowledge of the magic existing data is required and in the end what we are really writing are integration tests. But we don&#8217;t want integration tests.<\/p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.7digital.com\/dev\/\">7digital<\/a>, we are exposing more of our domain via HTTP APIs, in a \u201cNotSOA\u201d manner. To test each service by itself it becomes necessary to mock the dependencies.<\/p>\n<h3>Solutions.<\/h3>\n<p>There are a couple of solutions to this.<br \/>\nSet up an stub HTTP web service somewhere, and let it return canned responses. It behaves like the real web service, but only returns responses that have been arranged. The disadvantage of this approach is that I have to know about what canned responses have already been setup.<\/p>\n<p>To change the response for a particular test I have to make changes to the stub server and deploy it, as it is a separate application. It takes the focus away from writing the test I&#8217;m concerned with.<\/p>\n<p>Another way is to insert some sort of &#8220;switch&#8221; in production code that will return canned responses when under test. I don&#8217;t like this approach because it requires production code just for tests<\/p>\n<h3>My solution.<\/h3>\n<p>What I want to do is something similar to setting up mocks\/stubs in unit tests, but to do it with an actual http server.

Takes a few minutes to build. The build works painlessly on OSX and Linux. If you are on OSX install it via brew\n\n[http:\/\/shapeshed.com\/journal\/setting-up-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-osx\/](http:\/\/shapeshed.com\/journal\/setting-up-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-osx\/ \"http:\/\/shapeshed.com\/journal\/setting-up-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-osx\/\")\n\nThe documentation is at [http:\/\/nodejs.org\/docs\/v0.4.8\/api\/](http:\/\/nodejs.org\/docs\/v0.4.8\/api\/)\n\nNode.js is a good way to get into event driven non-blocking programming. It\u2019s easy to do this when you think about doing things (sending responses, rendering) only when things happen.\n\nFor example, when data arrives\u00a0on a socket listening on the server an event is triggered. Code is executed when events are triggered. Instead of polling and waiting for stuff to happen, which can be very in-efficient.\n\nThis got me thinking about tiny programs running in a system and only doing things as a result of something being triggered. This could lead to us writing code that is only needed by the system. Code that is not used by the system (i.e not triggered) are\u00a0culled.\n\n### [Treating JavaScript as a programming language.](http:\/\/www.spaconference.org\/spa2011\/sessions\/session369.html)\n\nGoing on with the js theme, the guys from Caplin Systems, showed how to build applications with js while still testing the full stack. We were shown how to use Eclipse and JSTestDriver. We were also taken thorough building the full application stack using\u00a0 domain and view models in js. While using a Model View View Model pattern with [knockout.js](http:\/\/knockoutjs.com\/) to bind the domain to client HTML.\n\n### [Master of Puppets](http:\/\/www.spaconference.org\/spa2011\/sessions\/session376.html)\n\nI had mixed feelings about attending this session but in the end it was worth it. [Puppet](http:\/\/www.puppetlabs.com\/) is an open source platform to manage systems, similar to [Chef](http:\/\/www.opscode.com\/). Puppet and Chef use recipes to build and configure machines. It seems to work smoothly with Ubuntu, using apt get to install and configure the software as specified in a recipe. Still no good Windows support though, which is going to make it hard to use at work.\n\nIt is also possible to use Puppet to control\/build virtual machines using [vagrant](http:\/\/vagrantup.com\/).

To start it off there was Rachel Davies\u2019 session on [building trust within teams](http:\/\/www.spaconference.org\/spa2011\/sessions\/session387.html). The slides from this are up now [http:\/\/www.agilexp.com\/presentations\/SPA-ImprovingTrustInTeams.pdf](http:\/\/www.agilexp.com\/presentations\/SPA-ImprovingTrustInTeams.pdf \"http:\/\/www.agilexp.com\/presentations\/SPA-ImprovingTrustInTeams.pdf\")\n\nBenjamin Mitchell\u2019s session on [double loop learning](http:\/\/www.spaconference.org\/spa2011\/sessions\/session403.html) was insightful. It made me think about how much my perception of things don\u2019t necessarily reflect the reality. It is better to seek knowledge than take actions based on assumptions. It became clear how easily we can fall into this trap. There is more reading on double loop learning and the work by Chris Argyris here\u00a0[http:\/\/bit.ly\/Argyris](http:\/\/bit.ly\/Argyris)\n\n[Developer anarchy at forward](http:\/\/www.spaconference.org\/spa2011\/sessions\/session394.html) clearly illustrated that to go faster, you need great devs and ditch technology that is slowing down feedback loops. It\u2019s not just about building feedback loops, its how fast you can react to those loops is what matters. On the Internet scale, we\u2019d would have to respond in seconds, minutes and at least in hours. Definitely not in days, sprints or months. In the conversation afterwards, learnt that they spent about 6 months re-building the tools and infrastructure that let them deliver at the speed that the do now.\n\n[Comic Communication and Collaboration](http:\/\/www.spaconference.org\/spa2011\/sessions\/session378.html) completed the SPA experience with much hilarity and fun. Think I could try my hand and xkcd style comics. More importantly, the insight learned was ,communicate by talking with peers, or communicate by producing something (i.e readable code, working software). If you have to communicate via email or worse through a 3rd party (i.e project manager) don\u2019t bother. It\u2019s not as effective as you think.\n\nAll in all, a very well organised conference, including the invited rants.

We attempt to treat these with the same care as our production code.\n\nThis post is about how it works.\n\n### A little bit about our stack. \n\nOur services run on the .Net stack, with SQL server back ends mostly. We use IIS 7and IIS 6, load balanced\u00a0 behind [HAproxy](http:\/\/haproxy.1wt.eu\/).\n\nWe use [Teamcity](http:\/\/www.jetbrains.com\/teamcity\/), to trigger Rake scripts, to do our deployments. The [Albacore gem](https:\/\/github.com\/derickbailey\/Albacore) is used for the majority of tasks. We use code derived from [Dolphin deploy](https:\/\/github.com\/BenHall\/DolphinDeploy) to configure IIS.\n\n\u00a0\n\n### In the beginning.\n\nWe used MSBuild for building our solutions and deploying software. However, this was very painful, and led me on a personal crusade to get rid of Msbuild for deployments.\u00a0 XML based build frameworks, limit what you can do to what is defined in the particular framework\u2019s vocabulary. A big pain was having to store configuration and code in the same msbuild xml files. It wasn\u2019t possible to separate the two without writing custom tasks.\n\nA build framework, in a programming language, allows you to be much more fluent and write readable scripts. You have the power to use all the libraries,\u00a0 at your disposal to write deployment code instead of being limited to a XML schema definition. In addition to Ruby, we have\u00a0 a couple of projects using Powershell and psake.\n\n### \u00a0\n\n### The current setup.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[![deployment](http:\/\/www.hibri.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/deployment_thumb.png \"deployment\")](http:\/\/www.hibri.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/deployment.png)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe diagram above shows the major parts of our deployment pipeline.\n\nWe keep the build and deployment code along with the project code, to maintain a self contained package, with minimal dependencies on anything else.\n\nA project has a master rake file, named rakefile.rb in the root directory of the project. This rake file references all the other shared rake scripts and ruby libraries needed for build and deployment.\n\nThese libraries and scripts are kept in a sub directory named build. A typical project structure is like;\n\n*root   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 build   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 conf   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 lib   \n\u00a0\u00a0 src   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 XX.Unit.Tests   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 XX.Integration.Tests   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 XX.Web*\n\nThe conf directory contains the configuration settings for IIS, including the host headers, app pool settings and .net framework version settings.\n\nThe [Albacore build](https:\/\/github.com\/derickbailey\/Albacore \"Rake tasks for .Net\") gem has everything that is needed to build a .Net solution. We use it to compile our code on Teamcity and to run our tests.\n\nWhen something is checked into VCS (git), Teamcity triggers off a build and compiles the code. This build process will package the deployment scripts and the web site package, which will be used for deployment. Teamcity stores these as artefacts, and this allows us to reuse them without building again.\n\nTo deploy a website, a Teamcity build agent, retrieves all necessary zipped packages, un-compresses them to the current working directory.\n\nThe build agent calls a rake task, with the parameters;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 rake deploy[environment, version_to_deploy, list_of_servers, build_number]\n\nAn example\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 rake deploy[\u201clive\u201d,\u201d1.2\u201d,\u201dserver1;server2;server3\u201d,\u201d123\u201d]\n\nThe environment parameter specifies which deployment settings to use.\u00a0 Deployment settings are stored in\u00a0 YAML files, that the rake scripts read.\u00a0 A YAML file for IIS settings looks like;\n\nuat: site_name: xxx.dns.uat host_header: 80:xxx.dns.uat:* 443:xxx.dns.uat:* dot_net_version: v4.0 live: site_name: xxx.dns.com host_header: 80:xxx.dns.com:* 443:xxx.dns.com:* dot_net_version: v4.0\n\n<style type=\"text\/css\"><p>.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre\n{\n\tfont-size: small;\n\tcolor: black;\n\tfont-family: consolas, \"Courier New\", courier, monospace;\n\tbackground-color: #ffffff;\n\t\/*white-space: pre;*\/\n}\n.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }\n.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }\n.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }\n.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }\n.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }\n.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }\n.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }\n.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }\n.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }\n.csharpcode .alt \n{\n\tbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\tmargin: 0em;\n}\n.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }<\/style>\u00a0\n\nWe can add a new environment, and change settings for an existing environment by changing a configuration .yml file, without having to change deployment scripts.\n\nThe version_to_deploy parameter, loosely translates to a virtual directory. This is ignored for websites that deploy to the root. The list of servers is an arbitrary list of servers that we deploy to. This allows us to deploy to a single server or a cluster.\n\nThe rake deploy task, calls two other rake tasks, for each server in the list of servers. The first task is to copy all deployment scripts and the web package to the target server. The second is to trigger a remote shell command to do the actual installation process.\n\nIn pseudo code\n\n\u00a0 *deploy  \n  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 foreach(server in servers) *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 copy scripts and packages to server\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 trigger remote installation on server\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe actual installation process does not happen from the build agent, but on the target server. The build agent does not have the the necessary network access and admin rights. Our servers expose only SSH.\n\nThe deployment sequence is controlled by chaining rake tasks. This allows us to run any of the tasks individually from the command line to do a manual deployment or to test.\n\nThe remote installation task, copies all the web site binaries to the correct locations under IIS, and configures IIS. Application pools under IIS are stopped, while this happens, and the virtual directory and if needed the web site are rebuilt. The application pools are restarted after this.\n\nThe deployment\u00a0 repeats the process on the next server in the list.\n\n\u00a0\n\n### The future.\n\nWhat we have now helps us a lot, and allow us to scale up to this point. However, to grow even more there are a few things that hold us back.\n\nFor example, a lot of infrastructure details creep into our configuration and scripts and stored in source control, which is mostly used by devs. This means that\u00a0 when our operations folk make a change to the infrastructure the devs have to change our configuration settings to reflect this. I would like to have all configuration settings stored somewhere, and the scripts would call out to a service to get all the settings for a particular environment and application. This service would be maintained by devops, and will be synchronized with changes made to the infrastructure.\n\nThe same can be done for the list of servers. Instead of a developer having knowledge of what servers comprise an environment, the script could ask the same service, to give a list of servers that are in a given environment. This will allow us to scale transparently, by adding a new server to the list and doing a fresh deploy.\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Summary.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to capture an overview of how we deploy our software at 7digital. There is a lot of detail I haven\u2019t gone into. Especially the nitty gritty of setting up IIS host headers, ports and app pool settings. A build and deployment framework is something we do from day one of any new project. We make sure that we have a skeleton application deployed all the way to production before any new code is written.\n\nFeel free to get in touch if you have any specific questions.\n\nResources:\n\n[http:\/\/codebetter.com\/benhall\/2010\/10\/22\/dolphin-deploy-deploying-asp-net-applications-using-ironruby\/](http:\/\/codebetter.com\/benhall\/2010\/10\/22\/dolphin-deploy-deploying-asp-net-applications-using-ironruby\/ \"http:\/\/codebetter.com\/benhall\/2010\/10\/22\/dolphin-deploy-deploying-asp-net-applications-using-ironruby\/\")\n\n[http:\/\/albacorebuild.net\/](http:\/\/albacorebuild.net\/ \"http:\/\/albacorebuild.net\/\")\n\n\n","html":"<p>At 7digital, deployments to a production environment are a non-event.

Teamcity stores these as artefacts, and this allows us to reuse them without building again.<\/p>\n<p>To deploy a website, a Teamcity build agent, retrieves all necessary zipped packages, un-compresses them to the current working directory.<\/p>\n<p>The build agent calls a rake task, with the parameters;<\/p>\n<p>&#160;&#160; rake deploy[environment, version_to_deploy, list_of_servers, build_number]<\/p>\n<p>An example<\/p>\n<p>&#160;&#160; rake deploy[\u201clive\u201d,\u201d1.2\u201d,\u201dserver1;server2;server3\u201d,\u201d123\u201d]<\/p>\n<p>The environment parameter specifies which deployment settings to use.&#160; Deployment settings are stored in&#160; YAML files, that the rake scripts read.&#160; A YAML file for IIS settings looks like;<\/p>\n<pre class=\"csharpcode\">uat:\n site_name: xxx.dns.uat\n host_header: 80:xxx.dns.uat:*\n                        443:xxx.dns.uat:*\n dot_net_version: v4.0\n\nlive:\n site_name: xxx.dns.com\n host_header: 80:xxx.dns.com:*\n                        443:xxx.dns.com:*\n dot_net_version: v4.0<\/pre>\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\n<p>.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre\n{\n\tfont-size: small;\n\tcolor: black;\n\tfont-family: consolas, \"Courier New\", courier, monospace;\n\tbackground-color: #ffffff;\n\t\/*white-space: pre;*\/\n}\n.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }\n.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }\n.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }\n.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }\n.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }\n.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }\n.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }\n.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }\n.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }\n.csharpcode .alt \n{\n\tbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\tmargin: 0em;\n}\n.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }<\/style>\n<p>&#160;<\/p>\n<p>We can add a new environment, and change settings for an existing environment by changing a configuration .yml file, without having to change deployment scripts. <\/p>\n<p>The version_to_deploy parameter, loosely translates to a virtual directory. This is ignored for websites that deploy to the root. The list of servers is an arbitrary list of servers that we deploy to. This allows us to deploy to a single server or a cluster.<\/p>\n<p>The rake deploy task, calls two other rake tasks, for each server in the list of servers. The first task is to copy all deployment scripts and the web package to the target server. The second is to trigger a remote shell command to do the actual installation process.<\/p>\n<p>In pseudo code<\/p>\n<p>&#160; <em>deploy<br \/>\n    <br \/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; foreach(server in servers) <\/p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; copy scripts and packages to server <\/p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; trigger remote installation<\/em> on server&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <\/p>\n<p>The actual installation process does not happen from the build agent, but on the target server. The build agent does not have the the necessary network access and admin rights. Our servers expose only SSH. <\/p>\n<p>The deployment sequence is controlled by chaining rake tasks. This allows us to run any of the tasks individually from the command line to do a manual deployment or to test.<\/p>\n<p>The remote installation task, copies all the web site binaries to the correct locations under IIS, and configures IIS. Application pools under IIS are stopped, while this happens, and the virtual directory and if needed the web site are rebuilt. The application pools are restarted after this.<\/p>\n<p>The deployment&#160; repeats the process on the next server in the list. <\/p>\n<p>&#160;<\/p>\n<h3>The future.<\/h3>\n<p>What we have now helps us a lot, and allow us to scale up to this point. However, to grow even more there are a few things that hold us back.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a lot of infrastructure details creep into our configuration and scripts and stored in source control, which is mostly used by devs. This means that&#160; when our operations folk make a change to the infrastructure the devs have to change our configuration settings to reflect this. I would like to have all configuration settings stored somewhere, and the scripts would call out to a service to get all the settings for a particular environment and application. This service would be maintained by devops, and will be synchronized with changes made to the infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>The same can be done for the list of servers. Instead of a developer having knowledge of what servers comprise an environment, the script could ask the same service, to give a list of servers that are in a given environment. This will allow us to scale transparently, by adding a new server to the list and doing a fresh deploy.<\/p>\n<p>&#160;<\/p>\n<h3>Summary.<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve tried to capture an overview of how we deploy our software at 7digital. There is a lot of detail I haven\u2019t gone into. Especially the nitty gritty of setting up IIS host headers, ports and app pool settings. A build and deployment framework is something we do from day one of any new project. We make sure that we have a skeleton application deployed all the way to production before any new code is written.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to get in touch if you have any specific questions.<\/p>\n<p>Resources:<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"http:\/\/codebetter.com\/benhall\/2010\/10\/22\/dolphin-deploy-deploying-asp-net-applications-using-ironruby\/\" href=\"http:\/\/codebetter.com\/benhall\/2010\/10\/22\/dolphin-deploy-deploying-asp-net-applications-using-ironruby\/\">http:\/\/codebetter.com\/benhall\/2010\/10\/22\/dolphin-deploy-deploying-asp-net-applications-using-ironruby\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"http:\/\/albacorebuild.net\/\" href=\"http:\/\/albacorebuild.net\/\">http:\/\/albacorebuild.net\/<\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sat, 28 Apr 2012 16:44:08 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 28 Apr 2012 17:21:02 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 28 Apr 2012 16:44:08 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":585,"title":"What do tests tell us ?","slug":"what-do-tests-tell-us","markdown":"\nBack in September 2012, I gave a talk at Dev\u2019s in the Ditch on what tests tell us.\u00a0 The talk resonated with a post by Matt Wynne today on fixing slow builds.\n\n[Optimising a slow build ?

Yay !!\n\n1. Run the node server process and restart automatically when I make changes\n2. Concatenate my client side JS code, and merge libraries such as angular, jquery and bootstrap.\n3. I don\u2019t want to check in concatenated files.\n4. I don\u2019t want to check in modules or libraries, even for client side scripts\n5. I want to catch typos and style violations.\n6. I want tests to run in the background.\n\n[Grunt](http:\/\/gruntjs.com\/) is the task runner I\u2019m using to automate the tasks. Let\u2019s look at each of these tasks.\n\nAutomate the NodeJS server process with [nodemon](https:\/\/github.com\/remy\/nodemon).\n\nnpm install --save-dev nodemon\n\nNow, run\n\nnodemon\n\nEventually, you\u2019ll want to trigger nodemon through grunt. Get the [grunt-nodemon](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/grunt-nodemon) plugin. The plugin registration and the Grunt config is below.\n\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-nodemon');\n\nnodemon: { dev: { script: 'bin\/www', ignore: ['node_modules\/**','bower_components\/**','public\/**'] } }\n\nI\u2019ve configured nodemon to ignore javascript that is not my code, and ignore changes to client side javascript. The path to the node server script is set in the script property. Since I\u2019ve used express to create an app, this is \u2018bin\/www\u2019.\n\nGreat, now executing ***grunt nodemon*** \u00a0will watch for changes and restart the server.\n\nNext, I want to avoid all those pesky typos, misplaced semi-colons and get into the habit of writing good Javascript. I\u2019ll use [JSHint](http:\/\/jshint.com\/).\n\nnpm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-jshint\n\nConfigure JSHint as below,\n\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n\njshint: { all: ['Gruntfile.js', 'lib\/**\/*.js', 'test\/**\/*.js','public\/javascripts\/app\/**\/*.js'] }\n\nThis configures JSHint to run on my tests, client side javascript and server code.\n\nAs with nodemon, I want JSHint running in the background and checking my code as I type and save files. This gives me quick feedback. Because JSHint doesn\u2019t do this, I\u2019ll introduce another plugin to the Gruntfile.\n\nThis is the [grunt watch](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/grunt-contrib-watch) plugin, which will watch for changes in my source directory and run other Grunt tasks.\n\nnpm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-watch\n\nConfigure grunt-watch as below,\n\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\n\nwatch: { scripts: { files: ['**\/*.js','!node_modules\/**','!bower_components\/**','!public\/javascripts\/dist\/**'], tasks: ['jshint'] } }\n\nThis sets up grunt-watch to watch over all of my code. Ignore directories\u00a0by placing an exclamation mark before the path spec.\n\nGreat, now if I execute ***grunt watch*** on the command line, it will start watching for changes and run jshint when a change is detected. Sweet.\n\nThere is a catch though. I want to run nodemon and watch at the same time. I could run both in separate shells, but that would mean switching back and forth.\n\nLet\u2019s introduce [grunt-concurrent](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/grunt-concurrent). This executes grunt tasks concurrently. Now I can run nodemon and watch at the same time.\n\nnpm install --save-dev grunt-concurrent\n\nConfigure as below;\n\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-concurrent');\n\nconcurrent: { dev: { tasks: ['nodemon', 'watch'], options: { logConcurrentOutput: true } } }\n\nThe config above, tells grunt-concurrent to run nodemon and watch. Both tasks\u00a0are grouped logically under a \u201cdev\u201d subtask.\n\nIf I execute ***grunt concurrent*** on the command line, I\u2019ll have my server restarting automatically and JSHint watching\u00a0my code. To reduce what I need to type even more, I\u2019ll set up grunt to run this task as default\n\ngrunt.registerTask('default', ['concurrent']);\n\nAll I need to do is type \u201cgrunt\u201d and have it do all the work done for me.\n\nThis gives me a \u00a0basic framework to add other tasks. Grunt allows me to group tasks. For example, I want to group all of my build time tasks as one. My build time tasks are to run jshint, run tests, merge libraries like angular and concatenate client side javascript.\n\ngrunt.registerTask('build', ['jshint','karma','concat','bower_concat']);\n\nInstead of watch running JSHint only, let\u2019s change it to run the ***build*** task.\n\nwatch: { scripts: { files: ['**\/*.js','!node_modules\/**','!bower_components\/**','!public\/javascripts\/dist\/**'], tasks: ['build'] } }\n\nHere is the complete Gruntfile [https:\/\/gist.github.com\/hibri\/6ccd0aef805353dc8260](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/hibri\/6ccd0aef805353dc8260)\n\nIn addition to the tasks described above, I\u2019ve also used the plugins listed below\n\n- grunt-bower-concat : merges all the dependencies installed via bower\n- grunt-contrib-concat : merges all the client side javascript I\u2019ve written. This includes all my angularjs code.\n- grunt-karma : To run tests\n- grunt-bower-task : To run bower install through grunt.\n\nYou\u2019ll also notice I\u2019ve got the following task configured.\n\ngrunt.registerTask('heroku:production', ['bower:install','concat', 'bower_concat']);\n\nThe deployment to Heroku uses the task. I want the concatenation to run when I push to production, so I don\u2019t have to check in any build artefacts to source control.\n\nHeroku doesn\u2019t run Grunt natively during a deploy, but they do support [build packs](https:\/\/devcenter.heroku.com\/articles\/buildpacks). I\u2019ve configured Heroku to use a nodejs buildpack with grunt support.\n\nSee\u00a0[https:\/\/github.com\/mbuchetics\/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt](https:\/\/github.com\/mbuchetics\/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt) for more.\n\nThis is the build framework I\u2019m starting with, and most certainly will grow with the project. A way of sharing ignored files between tasks would be nice. There is some duplication already.\n\nWhat\u2019s your workflow ?\n\n\n","html":"<p>I&#8217;m building a NodeJS + Angular application and there are\u00a0a few things I want a\u00a0smooth dev workflow and improve developer happiness. Yay !!<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Run the node server process and restart automatically when I make changes<\/li>\n<li>Concatenate my client side JS code, and merge libraries such as angular, jquery and bootstrap.<\/li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t want to check in concatenated files.<\/li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t want to check in modules or libraries, even for client side scripts<\/li>\n<li>I want to catch typos and style violations.<\/li>\n<li>I want tests to run in the background.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/gruntjs.com\/\">Grunt<\/a> is the task runner I&#8217;m using to automate the tasks. Let&#8217;s look at each of these tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Automate the NodeJS server process with <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/remy\/nodemon\">nodemon<\/a>.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">npm install --save-dev nodemon<\/pre>\n<p>Now, run<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">nodemon<\/pre>\n<p>Eventually, you&#8217;ll want to trigger nodemon through grunt. Get the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/grunt-nodemon\">grunt-nodemon<\/a> plugin. The plugin registration and the Grunt config is below.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-nodemon');\n\n<\/pre>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">nodemon: {\n    dev: {\n        script: 'bin\/www',\n        ignore:  ['node_modules\/**','bower_components\/**','public\/**']\n    }\n}<\/pre>\n<p>I&#8217;ve configured nodemon to ignore javascript that is not my code, and ignore changes to client side javascript. The path to the node server script is set in the script property. Since I&#8217;ve used express to create an app, this is &#8216;bin\/www&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>Great, now executing <strong><em>grunt nodemon<\/em><\/strong> \u00a0will watch for changes and restart the server.<\/p>\n<p>Next, I want to avoid all those pesky typos, misplaced semi-colons and get into the habit of writing good Javascript. I&#8217;ll use <a href=\"http:\/\/jshint.com\/\">JSHint<\/a>.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-jshint<\/pre>\n<p>Configure JSHint as below,<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n\n<\/pre>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">jshint: {\n    all: ['Gruntfile.js', 'lib\/**\/*.js', 'test\/**\/*.js','public\/javascripts\/app\/**\/*.js']\n}<\/pre>\n<p>This configures JSHint to run on my tests, client side javascript and server code.<\/p>\n<p>As with nodemon, I want JSHint running in the background and checking my code as I type and save files. This gives me quick feedback. Because JSHint doesn&#8217;t do this, I&#8217;ll introduce another plugin to the Gruntfile.<\/p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/grunt-contrib-watch\">grunt watch<\/a> plugin, which will watch for changes in my source directory and run other Grunt tasks.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-watch<\/pre>\n<p>Configure grunt-watch as below,<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');<\/pre>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">watch: {\n scripts: {\n files: ['**\/*.js','!node_modules\/**','!bower_components\/**','!public\/javascripts\/dist\/**'],\n tasks: ['jshint']\n }\n}<\/pre>\n<p>This sets up grunt-watch to watch over all of my code. Ignore directories\u00a0by placing an exclamation mark before the path spec.<\/p>\n<p>Great, now if I execute <em><strong>grunt watch<\/strong><\/em> on the command line, it will start watching for changes and run jshint when a change is detected. Sweet.<\/p>\n<p>There is a catch though. I want to run nodemon and watch at the same time. I could run both in separate shells, but that would mean switching back and forth.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s introduce <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/grunt-concurrent\">grunt-concurrent<\/a>. This executes grunt tasks concurrently. Now I can run nodemon and watch at the same time.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">npm install --save-dev grunt-concurrent<\/pre>\n<p>Configure as below;<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-concurrent');\n\n\n<\/pre>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">concurrent: {\n    dev: {\n        tasks: ['nodemon', 'watch'],\n        options: {\n            logConcurrentOutput: true\n        }\n    }\n}<\/pre>\n<p>The config above, tells grunt-concurrent to run nodemon and watch. Both tasks\u00a0are grouped logically under a &#8220;dev&#8221; subtask.<\/p>\n<p>If I execute <em><strong>grunt concurrent<\/strong><\/em> on the command line, I&#8217;ll have my server restarting automatically and JSHint watching\u00a0my code. To reduce what I need to type even more, I&#8217;ll set up grunt to run this task as default<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">grunt.registerTask('default', ['concurrent']);<\/pre>\n<p>All I need to do is type &#8220;grunt&#8221; and have it do all the work done for me.<\/p>\n<p>This gives me a \u00a0basic framework to add other tasks. Grunt allows me to group tasks. For example, I want to group all of my build time tasks as one. My build time tasks are to run jshint, run tests, merge libraries like angular and concatenate client side javascript.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">grunt.registerTask('build', ['jshint','karma','concat','bower_concat']);<\/pre>\n<p>Instead of watch running JSHint only, let&#8217;s change it to run the <em><strong>build<\/strong><\/em> task.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">watch: {\n scripts: {\n files: ['**\/*.js','!node_modules\/**','!bower_components\/**','!public\/javascripts\/dist\/**'],\n tasks: ['build']\n }\n}<\/pre>\n<p>Here is the complete Gruntfile <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/hibri\/6ccd0aef805353dc8260\">https:\/\/gist.github.com\/hibri\/6ccd0aef805353dc8260<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the tasks described above, I&#8217;ve also used the plugins listed below<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>grunt-bower-concat : merges all the dependencies installed via bower<\/li>\n<li>grunt-contrib-concat : merges all the client side javascript I&#8217;ve written. This includes all my angularjs code.<\/li>\n<li>grunt-karma : To run tests<\/li>\n<li>grunt-bower-task : To run bower install through grunt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also notice I&#8217;ve got the following task configured.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">grunt.registerTask('heroku:production', ['bower:install','concat', 'bower_concat']);<\/pre>\n<p>The deployment to Heroku uses the task. I want the concatenation to run when I push to production, so I don&#8217;t have to check in any build artefacts to source control.<\/p>\n<p>Heroku doesn&#8217;t run Grunt natively during a deploy, but they do support <a href=\"https:\/\/devcenter.heroku.com\/articles\/buildpacks\">build packs<\/a>. I&#8217;ve configured Heroku to use a nodejs buildpack with grunt support.<\/p>\n<p>See\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mbuchetics\/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt\">https:\/\/github.com\/mbuchetics\/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt<\/a> for more.<\/p>\n<p>This is the build framework I&#8217;m starting with, and most certainly will grow with the project. A way of sharing ignored files between tasks would be nice. There is some duplication already.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s your workflow

Donuts","slug":"on-donuts","markdown":"\nDonuts. The Krispy Kreme assorted box of donuts. They\u2019ve been a recurring theme during the last decade of my career. Once or twice a month I\u2019ll bring two or more boxes to the office on a Friday \u00a0morning. I\u2019ll put them close to the area where my team sits. I\u2019ll go to my desk and compose an email to the staff mailing list, with one word on the subject line.\n\n*\u201cDonuts\u201d*\n\nMany would ask, while munching on a vanilla cream donut, if it was my birthday, and I\u2019d say no. My reason for bringing in donuts, I said \u201cJust because I wanted to\u201d.\n\nHowever, there is a reason. The tyre shaped treats were another way of building my people skills, and getting to collaborate with others outside of my team. Mostly the rest of the company. \u00a0There is an official name for \u00a0this pattern of providing donuts. Coined by [Linda Rising](http:\/\/www.lindarising.org\/) in her book, [Fearless Change](http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Fearless-Change-patterns-introducing-ideas\/dp\/0201741571\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427641656&sr=8-1&keywords=linda+rising) It\u2019s the Do Food pattern.\n\nSharing food, made it easier for me to discuss difficult topics, and approach people to get things done. I didn\u2019t have to appeal to their rational mind. I didn\u2019t have to make convincing arguments. Didn\u2019t have to use data. Minds are\u00a0already made up.\n\n*\u201d I\u2019ll listen to him, He\u2019s the guy who brings me donuts\u201d*.\n\nThis post is inspired by a former colleague\u2019s [post on Emotional Intelligence for teams](http:\/\/blog.ntcoding.com\/2015\/03\/proposing-emotional-intelligence.html). It made me think of my own path to improving my people skills. I\u2019m the archetypical techie. People don\u2019t compute. Humans aren\u2019t programmable. Yet, this thing called \u201cCollaboration\u201d is pretty damn important if you want to build the right thing, and change people into adopting ways of working that makes us happier.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty damn important if you want to enjoy building software. I\u2019ve seen it too many times. Frustrated developers, unsatisfied customers, stressed managers and flaky software. I had to learn more tricks to make changes. Here are a few.\n\n### Have a bag of tasty treats on your desk.\n\nLike the donuts, I normally have a box of chocolates or some other candy on my desk (I also have healthier options like cashew nuts and fruit).\n\nWhy ? It\u2019s easier to have a conversation whilst eating something nice. People see the treats and come over to ask what \u00a0you are working on. You can then pitch your idea and start evangelising your vision. People listen while munching.\n\nEven more, take said bag of treats over when you need to get something done, especially when working with sysadmins\/ops folk.\n\nNo candy ? *\u201cDid you raise a ticket for that?\u201d* .\n\nWith candy, *\u201cLet me get that done for you after this\u201d*.\n\nMost likely to do with the brain experiencing pleasure making difficult decisions more enjoyable. There is\u00a0some science to this, but let someone else figure it out. It works.\n\nThis is your only option since buying someone an alcoholic \u00a0drink during working hours, in the office is frowned upon in certain uptight cultures.\n\n### Lead your own retrospectives.\n\nOfficially, a retrospective is supposed to be lead by a neutral facilitator. I get quizzical looks when I say I\u2019m leading the retrospective for my own team, because that is not the format. \u00a0Why do I do it ?\n\nIt\u2019s a good way to observe your team, in a relaxed setting. In the early stages of forming a team, badly run retrospectives can have a negative impact and It\u2019s important to have effective\u00a0retrospectives early on.\u00a0When introducing a collaborative culture and it\u2019s not always easy to find good retrospective facilitators. This is sometimes where agile adoption fails, because of ineffective retrospectives.\n\nLeading a retrospective, as a team\/tech lead allows you to show leadership in non-technical areas. The team will feel like they can talk to you about the issues they are facing, instead of an external facilitator. \u00a0You can also try innovative retrospective ideas that are tuned to your team\u2019s current situation.\n\n### Read Maverick by Ricardo Semler.\n\n[This is the book that convinced me](http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Maverick-Success-Behind-Unusual-Workplace\/dp\/0712678867\/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427641975&sr=1-1&keywords=maverick) that there is a better way of working than what is experienced in most places. Trust, transparency, diversity and giving the space to do what they want, brings out the best in everyone. \u00a0The book is full of ideas on how to improve working practices, and to deal with the complex issues that arise with a work place democracy.\n\n### Observe first, reflect\u00a0and\u00a0then talk.\n\nTake all the time you need to observe and reflect.

The Krispy Kreme assorted box of donuts. They&#8217;ve been a recurring theme during the last decade of my career. Once or twice a month I&#8217;ll bring two or more boxes to the office on a Friday \u00a0morning. I&#8217;ll put them close to the area where my team sits. I&#8217;ll go to my desk and compose an email to the staff mailing list, with one word on the subject line.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Donuts&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Many would ask, while munching on a vanilla cream donut, if it was my birthday, and I&#8217;d say no. My reason for bringing in donuts, I said &#8220;Just because I wanted to&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is a reason. The tyre shaped treats were another way of building my people skills, and getting to collaborate with others outside of my team. Mostly the rest of the company. \u00a0There is an official name for \u00a0this pattern of providing donuts. Coined by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lindarising.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Linda Rising<\/a> in her book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Fearless-Change-patterns-introducing-ideas\/dp\/0201741571\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427641656&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=linda+rising\" target=\"_blank\">Fearless Change<\/a> It&#8217;s the Do Food pattern.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing food, made it easier for me to discuss difficult topics, and approach people to get things done. I didn&#8217;t have to appeal to their rational mind. I didn&#8217;t have to make convincing arguments. Didn&#8217;t have to use data. Minds are\u00a0already made up.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8221; I&#8217;ll listen to him, He&#8217;s the guy who brings me donuts&#8221;<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This post is inspired by a former colleague&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.ntcoding.com\/2015\/03\/proposing-emotional-intelligence.html\" target=\"_blank\">post on Emotional Intelligence for teams<\/a>. It made me think of my own path to improving my people skills. I&#8217;m the archetypical techie. People don&#8217;t compute. Humans aren&#8217;t programmable. Yet, this thing called &#8220;Collaboration&#8221; is pretty damn important if you want to build the right thing, and change people into adopting ways of working that makes us happier.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty damn important if you want to enjoy building software. I&#8217;ve seen it too many times. Frustrated developers, unsatisfied customers, stressed managers and flaky software. I had to learn more tricks to make changes. Here are a few.<\/p>\n<h3>Have a bag of tasty treats on your desk.<\/h3>\n<p>Like the donuts, I normally have a box of chocolates or some other candy on my desk (I also have healthier options like cashew nuts and fruit).<\/p>\n<p>Why ? It&#8217;s easier to have a conversation whilst eating something nice. People see the treats and come over to ask what \u00a0you are working on. You can then pitch your idea and start evangelising your vision. People listen while munching.<\/p>\n<p>Even more, take said bag of treats over when you need to get something done, especially when working with sysadmins\/ops folk.<\/p>\n<p>No candy ? <em>&#8220;Did you raise a ticket for that?&#8221;<\/em> .<\/p>\n<p>With candy, <em>&#8220;Let me get that done for you after this&#8221;<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Most likely to do with the brain experiencing pleasure making difficult decisions more enjoyable. There is\u00a0some science to this, but let someone else figure it out. It works.<\/p>\n<p>This is your only option since buying someone an alcoholic \u00a0drink during working hours, in the office is frowned upon in certain uptight cultures.<\/p>\n<h3>Lead your own retrospectives.<\/h3>\n<p>Officially, a retrospective is supposed to be lead by a neutral facilitator. I get quizzical looks when I say I&#8217;m leading the retrospective for my own team, because that is not the format. \u00a0Why do I do it ?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good way to observe your team, in a relaxed setting. In the early stages of forming a team, badly run retrospectives can have a negative impact and It&#8217;s important to have effective\u00a0retrospectives early on.\u00a0When introducing a collaborative culture and it&#8217;s not always easy to find good retrospective facilitators. This is sometimes where agile adoption fails, because of ineffective retrospectives.<\/p>\n<p>Leading a retrospective, as a team\/tech lead allows you to show leadership in non-technical areas. The team will feel like they can talk to you about the issues they are facing, instead of an external facilitator. \u00a0You can also try innovative retrospective ideas that are tuned to your team&#8217;s current situation.<\/p>\n<h3>Read Maverick by Ricardo Semler.<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Maverick-Success-Behind-Unusual-Workplace\/dp\/0712678867\/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427641975&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=maverick\" target=\"_blank\">This is the book that convinced me<\/a> that there is a better way of working than what is experienced in most places. Trust, transparency, diversity and giving the space to do what they want, brings out the best in everyone. \u00a0The book is full of ideas on how to improve working practices, and to deal with the complex issues that arise with a work place democracy.<\/p>\n<h3>Observe first, reflect\u00a0and\u00a0then talk.<\/h3>\n<p>Take all the time you need to observe and reflect.
