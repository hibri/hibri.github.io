I’m a programmer. I love building great software and I love building great teams that go on to build great software.

I’m a generalist. Even though I’ve mostly worked on the Microsoft.Net stack for over a decade, I’ve used a variety of tools to solve problems. I’ve worked with Java, PHP, and VB in the past. Lately, I’ve been working with Ruby and JavaScript, and am excited about the NodeJS ecosystem. I’m platform agnostic and work on both Windows and Linux environments. (There was a brief foray into Solaris in the past.)

The Agile practices mirror the way I want to work. I advocate Test Driven Development, and get a kick out of teaching it. I enjoy working on automation and continuous delivery. I’ve built continuous deployment frameworks to help my teams deliver anytime they choose, and the amount of time I spend automating releases to production makes me think I should wear my sysadmin hat more often.

In the past I’ve worked for 7digital and BBC Worldwide, Audio Network, and Energyhelpline leading teams and building great products.

I’m available for consulting and coaching work. If you’d like to know how I can help you, please do get in touch.
